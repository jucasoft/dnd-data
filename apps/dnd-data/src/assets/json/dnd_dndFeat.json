    "benefit": "When you cast a spell that damages an aberration, you deal an extra 2d6 points of damage. A single spell can never gain this extra damage more than once per casting. For instance, a fireball deals the extra damage to all aberrations in the area it affects. However, if a 3rd-level wizard casts magic missile and produces two missiles, only one of them (of the wizard's choice) gains the extra damage, whether both missiles are directed at the same aberration or two different ones. If a spell deals damage for more than 1 round, it deals this extra damage in each round. Scrolls scribed by you and scrolls activated by you do not gain any benefit from Aberration Banemagic. The same is true for most other magic items, such as wands and potions. However, staffs activated by you not only use your caster level but also gain the benefit of this feat, if applicable. If the spell allows a saving throw, the DC of the saving throw increases by 2. The extra damage dealt by this spell is either halved on a successful saving throw or negated, depending on how the regular damage dealt by the spell is affected by a successful save.",

For example, a 4th-level paladin has a masterwork bastard sword she inherited from her grandfather. She makes sacrifices worth 2,000 gp and spends two days in prayer and fasting in the temple of Heironeous. When she emerges, her devotion has awakened the magic inherent in the blade, making it a +1 bastard sword.

Thus, only 1st-level vestiges are available to you, and you can bind to only one vestige at a time. Furthermore, unlike characters with the soul binding class feature, you gain only one power from the vestige you bind, as given on Table 1-9: \n\nh4. Bind Vestige Feat Abilities \n\nTo contact a vestige, you must draw its unique seal visibly on a surface (generally the ground), making the image at least 5 feet across. Drawing a seal requires the ability to mark a surface and 1 minute of concentration, and the act provokes attacks of opportunity. A seal not used within 1 minute of its drawing loses all potency, and you must draw a new one to contact the vestige. A vestige might also have other requirements for contact, as noted in its entry (see The Vestiges, page 16).\n\nOnce the seal is drawn, you must perform a ritual, requiring a full-round action to summon the corresponding vestige.  During this time, you must touch the seal and call out to the vestige using both its name and its title. The ritual fails if you cannot be heard (for example, if you are within the area of a \"_Silence_\":/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/silence--2704/ spell). Otherwise, a manifestation of the vestige appears in the seal's space as soon as you finish the ritual. This image is not the actual vestige; it is merely a figment--an illusion that cannot harm or be harmed by any creature. \n\nCreatures that interact with the image or study it carefully automatically recognize it as illusory. The summoned image ignores everyone but you, and if you fail to address it for 1 round, it disappears whence it came. The vestige speaks in whatever language you used to call it. \n\nTo make a pact with your summoned vestige, you must make a binding check (1d20 + your effective binder level + your Cha modifier). This process requires 1 minute, but you can choose to make a rushed binding check as a full-round action at a --10 penalty. The DC for this check is provided in the description of each vestige (see pages 16--49).  You must make your perilous pact alone; others cannot aid you in any way. \n\nWhether the binding check succeeds or fails, you gain the power granted by the vestige for 24 hours. During that time, you cannot rid yourself of the vestige unless you possess the \"Expel Vestige\":/feats/tome-of-magic--89/expel-vestige--991/ feat. If you fail the binding check, however, the vestige influences your personality and your actions, and you are said to have made a poor pact. (Specifically, the vestige's presence changes your general demeanor, and it can force you to perform or retrain from certain actions. The influence of each vestige is described in its individual entry) If your binding check is successful, the vestige has no control over your actions and does not influence your personality. In this case, you are said to have made a good pact. \n\nWhile under the influence of a vestige, you must adhere to its requirements to the best of your ability, if you are conscious and free-willed and you encounter a situation in which you cannot or will not refrain from a prohibited action or perform a required one, you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and checks until that vestige leaves you. \n\nAs long as you are bound to a vestige, you manifest a specific physical sign of its presence, as given in its entry. This sign is real, not an illusory or shapechanging effect, and someone using true seeing perceives it just as it is. You can hide a sign by mundane or magical means without penalty.\n\nThe vestige is bound to your soul by the pact. It cannot be targeted or expelled by any means except the \"Expel Vestige\":/feats/tome-of-magic--89/expel-vestige--991/ feat, nor can it be suppressed except by an antimagic field or similar effect. \n\nThe Difficulty Class for a saving throw against any supernatural powers granted by a vestige is 10 +1/2 your effective binder level -+- your Cha modifier.",

If the spell normally allows a saving throw, the target takes half the negative energy damage on a successful save, regardless of the outcome of the save on the spell's normal effect. In addition to its normal spell components, a Moilian spell requires the creation and expenditure of a Moilian runebone-- a small human bone (often a fi nger bone) scribed with carefully prepared arcane markings. Only a character trained in the Black Lore of Moil knows the secrets of creating a runebone, which takes 1 hour to craft and requires special inks and powders costing 25 gp per die of negative energy damage to be generated. For example, a runebone capable of adding 3d6 points of negative energy damage to a spell costs 75 gp to craft. While the maximum negative energy damage dealt by a Moilian spell is based on the spell's level, the actual damage is limited by the runebone. For example, if a sorcerer casts fi nger of death (a 7th-level spell, so normally +4d6) with a 75-gp (3d6) runebone, the spell deals only 3d6 points of additional negative energy damage. A Moilian spell uses a spell slot of the spell's normal level.",

If there is not enough space for this to occur, you can't activate the feat. Then, you suffer the harmful effect as if you were the intended target; the ally is unaffected by it. In addition to the obvious harmful effect this has upon you, this action is a drain on your personal energy. Once the effect of the intervention is resolved, you become fatigued. You cannot use this feat if you are exhausted or if you are immune to fatigue. You can choose to activate this feat after the success or failure of the harmful effect is determined, but you must activate it before the extent of the effect is determined and/or applied to the ally. Example: If an adjacent ally is attacked, you could wait until after the attack roll (and confi rmation roll, if the attack is a critical threat) is made to activate the feat, but you would have to activate it before damage is rolled. If the adjacent creature also benefi ts from a miss chance, you could wait until after that roll was made to activate the feat. Example: If an adjacent creature is within the area of a lightning bolt spell, you could wait until the creature rolls its saving throw (and checks its spell resistance, if any), but you would have to activate the feat before the spell's damage is rolled. If an adjacent creature is targeted by an attack that deals a fi xed amount of damage, such as a maximized magic missile spell, you would choose to activate this feat after the spell hit the target, but before damage was applied. By activating this feat, you give up any opportunity to avoid the harmful effect normally allowed by a saving throw, spell resistance, AC, or concealment. If the effect allows a saving throw or spell resistance, you automatically fail the save or spell resistance check. If the effect requires an attack roll, it automatically hits you (and if it scored a critical hit, it automatically scores a critical hit on you), even if you would normally benefi t from a miss chance against the attack. Any immunities or resistances you have apply normally; for example, if you are immune to critical hits, an attacker can't score a critical hit on you just because he scored one on the ally. If you can't physically interact with or manipulate objects (for instance, if you are incorporeal or in gaseous form, or if either you or the ally, but not both of you, are ethereal), you can't switch places with the ally and thus can't activate this feat. It should go without saying, but if you are incapable of taking an action (dazed, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, and so on), you can't use this feat.",

When you activate ape&#39;s fury, fur sprouts all over your body and remains until the effect ends. <br /><em>Cheetah&#39;s Sprint:</em> Gain a +5-foot sacred (if your deity is good or neutral) or profane (if your deity is evil) bonus to your base land speed.

A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier) negates the Constitution damage. Creatures immune to poison are immune to this effect.

In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on \"Intimidate\":skills/intimidate/ checks. The brand grants an additional benefit, depending upon the archdevil with which it is associated. \n\n_Bel_: The brand of Bel is a cold iron longsword or greatsword (your choice) that glistens with green hellfire. This weapon deals normal damage appropriate to your size, plus an extra 1d6 points of damage against good-aligned creatures, or an extra 2d6 points of damage against demons. You are proficient with this weapon, even if you normally lack weapon proficiency with the longsword or greatsword. \n\n_Dispater_: In keeping with your lord's fearful paranoia, you grow a pair of eyes in the back of your head. You cannot be flanked, nor can you be caught flat-footed. \n\n_Mammon_: The brand of Mammon allows you to better play the careful game of balance necessary of all devils. When faced with mighty foes, you grovel and ask for mercy. Against weaker enemies, you show no quarter.

Creatures with fewer HD than you, or any creature at half its maximum hit points or less (even one with more HD than you), suffer a different effect from this aura. These creatures become shaken (Will negates, DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifier) as you take on a ghastly, enraged aspect in their eyes. A creature with more HD than you that is subsequently reduced to half hit points must make a new save against this version of your aura. If it fails, the creature becomes shaken but it no longer takes the -2 penalty on attack rolls described above (if it failed its save against the first aura effect). This aura is a mind-affecting ability. A creature needs to save against each version of the aura only once every 24 hours. The aura's effect last as long as a creature is within its area. \n\n_Fierna and Belial_: The brand of Fierna and Belial consumes you, infesting your thoughts with sinister urges. Once per round, you can use a melee touch attack to bestow these dark impulses on another creature. The target of this ability must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifier). If it fails this save, the target is dazed for 1 round, lost in starry dreams of endless treasure, arcane might, and wishes fulfilled. You can use this mind-affecting ability once every 1d4 rounds. \n\n_Levistus_: The brand of Levistus grants you a mystical link to that trapped archdevil's prison. Once per day as a swift action, you become encased in armor of ice. You gain resistance to cold 20, and all of your natural attacks deal an extra 1d6 points of cold damage. This benefit lasts for 10 minutes. \n\n_Glasya_: The brand of Glasya fills you with power, drawn from the shuddering remains of the Hag Countess. Once per day, you can activate this ability as a swift action. You gain fast healing 3 for 1 minute. Pulpy, tumorous flesh erupts from your wounds to seal your injuries. \n\n_Baalzebul_: This brand causes your body to sweat a glistening slime. You gain a +4 bonus on grapple and Escape Artist checks.

If you are grappled or struck by an unarmed attack, your attacker takes 1d6 points of fire damage. At the start of each of your turns, any creatures in squares adjacent to you take 1d6 points of fire damage. \n\n_Asmodeus_: The brand of Asmodeus fills you with power and authority.

If this check succeeds, your opponent loses either his Dexterity bonus to AC or his shield bonus to AC (your choice) until the end of your current turn. Whirling Cloak: You can attempt to use your cloak to confuse your opponent. As a move action after successfully striking an opponent in melee, make a melee touch attack against that foe.

As your foe swings at you, you slip out of the way, causing his attack to slam into one of his allies. By positioning yourself correctly and making yourself an appealing target, you dupe your foe into making a critical blunder. To use this maneuver, you must be successfully attacked by a foe. On your next turn, you can take a move action to make a Bluff check opposed by his Sense Motive check. If you succeed on the check, you can take an immediate action at the start of your foe's next turn and designate a different target for your opponent's next melee attack (which must be a creature it threatens). Play Dead: You crumple to the ground as if slain, luring your opponent into a false sense of security. As an immediate action after you are hit for at least 10 points of damage by a single attack, you can attempt to play dead. You drop prone and make a Bluff check opposed by your attacker's (or any other relevant observer's) Sense Motive check. If you succeed on this check, the observer assumes you are dead. If you subsequently rise and attack him in the same round, he loses any attack of opportunity he might have been entitled to against you, and he loses his Dexterity bonus to AC against the fi rst attack that you make. You can use this ability once per encounter. Standing up after playing dead does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Sneering Glower: With just the right mix of your intimidating presence and your martial talents, you strike such fear into your target that he has diffi culty fighting you effectively. On your next turn after you deal at least 1 point of damage to your opponent, you can make an Intimidate check against him as a move action. If you succeed on this check, your foe takes a penalty on his attack rolls against you equal to your Charisma bonus. You can gain this benefit against only one foe at a time; it lasts for the duration of the encounter or until you switch targets. If you designate a new target for this ability (by attempting a new Intimidate check against a different creature), the previous target no longer takes the penalty on his attack rolls against you.

The nature of power point storage, at least in conjunction with this feat, allows a maximum of 17 power points to be stored in a single crystal capacitor. Moreover, a crystal capacitor's maximum is always an odd number. For instance, you'd never find a crystal capacitor with a maximum storage capacity of 6 power points (but you would find those that store a maximum of 5 or 7), or one that stores more than 17. Note that during use, a crystal capacitor very often contains even numbers of power points, just not when fully charged. Crafting a crystal capacitor takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a crystal capacitor is equal to the highest-level power it could manifest using all its stored power points, squared, multiplied by 1,000 gp. For example, the highest-level power a crystal capacitor that stores 5 power points could be used to manifest is a 3rd-level power: 3 x 3 x 1,000 = 9,000 gp.

The flames of your second spell turn some of the lingering acid into choking, sickening fumes. Any living creature damaged by both spells is nauseated for 1 round. Those who make a successful Fortitude save (DC based on the second spell) are sickened for 1 round instead. Treat this as a poison effect for the purpose of save bonuses and immunities. Brittle Blast: You cast a cold spell followed by a sonic spell. Any object or construct damaged by both spells takes +50% damage from the sonic spell, because its physical structure has been made brittle by the cold. Improved Conduction: You cast a cold spell followed by an electricity spell. The lingering cold more effectively conducts the electricity, temporarily fatiguing creatures. Living creatures damaged by both spells are slowed for 1 round (as the slow spell). Creatures that make successful Fortitude saves (DC based on the second spell) are fatigued for 1 round.",

Creatures immune to mind-affecting spells and abilities cannot be affected by this feat; regardless of the outcome of the opposed check, a creature can be affected only once by each of these maneuvers in a 24-hour period. Cringe: You change your features to appear weak and unworthy of an opponent's best efforts. To use this maneuver, you must use your minor change shape ability and take the total defense action in the same turn. You then make a Bluff check as a free action. From the end of your turn until the beginning of your next turn, any opponent that attempts to make a melee attack against you must make a Sense Motive check opposed by your Bluff check result. Failure means that the opponent takes a -5 penalty on weapon damage rolls (minimum 1 point) against you for 1 minute. Taunt: You change your features to mock an opponent. To use this maneuver, you must use your minor change shape ability to mimic the features of a selected target creature, who must be no more than 10 feet from you, must have missed you with a melee or ranged attack in the previous round, and is a humanoid, monstrous humanoid, or giant. You then make a Bluff check as a free action, opposed by the selected creature's Sense Motive check. If your check is successful, your foe takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 1 minute.

To use this maneuver, you must hit the target creature with a melee attack and use your minor change shape ability in the same round.

    "benefit": "You can interpret the basic symbolism of a dream to fi gure out what sorts of concerns or fears are likely to have inspired it. Dream Being Interpreted ---- Knowledge (the planes) DC. Features obvious symbolism ---- 10. Involves cultural details or concepts with which you are not very familiar ---- 15. Represents memories of past events with which you are not familiar ---- 20.  Both the previous conditions are true ---- 25. Attempting to garner insight into future events, or events occurring elsewhere, by reading the prophetic images of a dream adds +10 to +20 to the base DC, depending on how obscure the omens are. The DM must decide if a dream contains prophetic imagery; a suffi ciently high roll might glean some information even if the dream was not overtly oracular. Making the DC required to interpret a dream grants information comparable to an augury spell (see page 202 of the Player's Handbook). Exceeding the required check by 10 or more offers information comparable to a divination spell (see page 224 of the Player's Handbook). Exceeding the required check by 20 or more offers information comparable to a commune spell (see page 211 of the Player's Handbook). Even if your result was not high enough to enable you to read prophetic images, the result might be sufficient to interpret basic symbols and events. Thus, a check result of 18 is insuffi cient to foretell the future but still grants some information about cultural details or concepts. You can use this feat to determine what effect injuries received in a dreamscape are likely to have on you once you return (DC 15), or whether an item or location was created by the dreamer or brought in from outside (DC 20); see Chapter 3 for information on adventuring within dreamscapes. Finally, this feat allows Knowledge (the planes) to function in place of Survival when used within a dreamscape. This skill can be used to retrace your steps and return to a known person's dream, or to attempt to track a creature across the dreamscape. Action: Dreamtelling requires careful analysis of bizarre images and events. If you are trying to interpret your own dream, you must cogitate on it for a number of minutes equal to 30 minus your Intelligence modifi er. If you wish to analyze someone else's dream, that person must fi rst describe it to you in great detail, adding an additional 10+1d10 minutes to the process. Try Again: No. The check represents your ability to interpret that particular dream. You can attempt to interpret other dreams the same individual has later, but you get only one attempt per dream. Similarly, you have only one attempt to determine whether an item is native to a particular dream.",

If a spell has a secondary effect, the altered spell still has that effect. For example, a shout spell can deafen creatures and deals extra damage to crystalline creatures; if fire is substituted for sonic energy in a shout spell, creatures can still be deafened and crystalline creatures still suffer extra damage. Sometimes a spell's minor effects are directly related to the spell's energy, for example, a flaming sphere can set items afire, but a purely sonic or acidic flaming sphere does not. When a spell deals some damage that does not come from energy, Energy Substitution does not affect that portion of the spell. For example, ice storm deals 3d6 points of impact damage and 2d6 points of cold damage. An electrical ice storm deals 3d6 points of impact damage and 2d6 points of electricity damage.

You must make a double move and attempt a Tumble check at a -5 penalty to avoid a foe's attack of opportunity.

If you make a successful melee attack against an opponent who has walls adjacent to at least two sides of his space, you can make a special Tumble check on your next turn. This check requires a full-round action. As part of this action, make a Tumble check to move through the target's space. On a successful check, you stop in his space (rather than move past him) and attack as part of your full-round action. If the check fails, you provoke an attack of opportunity, and the rest of your full-round action is wasted. If your melee attack hits, you move your foe S feet in a direction of your choice. You now occupy the space that he occupied {or one of the spaces of your choice). If your melee attack misses, you return to the space you occupied when you started this maneuver.

Before beginning the process, you must secure a demon whose Hit Dice equal or exceed the caster level of the item or spell in question. The demon could be one that you summoned with a planar ally spell, or one that you have bound with a planar binding spell, or even one that you simply encountered and convinced to aid you. The demon need not be willing, but it must remain within 30 feet of you for the duration of your work on the item or the casting time of the spell, and you must have line of effect (but not necessarily line of sight) to it during that time. Drawing essence from a demon does not increase the time required to craft the item or cast the spell, but the process is draining for both you and the demon. Each of you takes ld6 points of Constitution damage when the essence is channeled from the demon into your body, then converted into magical energy. An unwilling demon can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier) to resist removal of its essence. Success negates your use of this feat and forces you to either pay the full cost yourself or abort the creation or casting. Successfully drawing essence from a demon in this way reduces the XP cost of the spell or item creation by one-half, but it complicates the process. If you use this feat to reduce the XP cost of a spell, you must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 20 + the demon's HD) to cast the spell. If you use this feat to offset the XP cost of crafting a magic item, the demon's essence has a 10% chance to corrupt the item in some way, imbuing it with a curse.

Favors can also be used to acquire the loan of equipment or documents from infl uential acquaintances. To call in a favor, you make a favor check. Roll a d20 and add a bonus based on your character level: +1 at 1st-2nd level, +2 at 3rd-6th level, +3 at 7th-11th level, +4 at 12th- 15th level, or +5 at 16th level or higher. The DM sets the DC based on the scope of the favor being requested; it can range from 10 for a simple favor to as high as 25 for highly dangerous, expensive, or illegal favors. You can't take 10 or take 20 on this check, nor can you retry the check for the same (or virtually the same) favor. Favors should help advance the plot of an adventure. A favor that would enable you to circumvent an adventure will always be unavailable to you, regardless of the result of a favor check. You can try to call in a favor a number of times per week equal to one-half your character level, rounded down (minimum one). You can never ask for more than one favor from any one contact in a given week. For instance, at 7th level you can try to call in a favor as many as three times per week, but each attempt must involve a different contact from among those associated with your mercantile house. The DM will carefully monitor your use of favors to ensure that you don't abuse this ability.

Powers that do not allow saving throws gain no advantage if they are made into knockdown powers.

    "benefit": "To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. Manifesting a power altered by this feat means that you must choose two powers--one you intend to manifest in this round, and one you intend to manifest in the next round. The power that is manifested in this round is not altered in any way, nor is the linked power that goes off in the next round--however, you do not need to spend any of your actions or power points next round to manifest the linked power. The linked power is automatically targeted on the same area or target as the power you manifest in this round (if the power you manifest this round has no area or target, choose an area or target in this round for the linked power to affect in the next round). If the same creature is targeted by both powers, the target experiences all the effects of both powers individually and receives a saving throw (if applicable) for each. In some cases, such as a psionic charm followed by a linked psionic charm, failing both saving throws results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm effect). It is possible that by the time the linked power comes into effect on the following round, the area where it goes off or the target that it affects no longer has relevance. On the other hand, you are free on the subsequent round to take actions normally. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power manifested this round by a number equal to the power point cost of the linked power. Thus if you manifest energy stun (3 power points) and energy burst (5 power points) as the linked power, the metapsionic cost is 8.

If the target of this blast was casting a spell when you threw the thunderstone, he must make a Concentration check opposed by your Craft (alchemy) check.

If the target was not casting a spell, he must make a Will save opposed by your Craft (alchemy) check or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, checks, and saves until the beginning of your next turn. Fiery Blaze: To use this maneuver, you must fi rst strike a creature with a container of lantern oil or alchemist's fi re. On your next turn, you must strike the creature with a spell or weapon attack that dealsfiredamage. If you do so, the creature takes an extra 1d6 points offiredamage and catches onfireif it is not already in fl ames. Tanglefoot Defense: By tearing open a tanglefoot bag and spreading its contents across an area, you can create a vexing barrier that hinders an opponent's approach.

    "benefit": "When you cast a spell, you can choose to apply one or both of the following effects to the spell. The decision to add the effect(s) must be made during casting. By channeling the churning chaos of Kythri, you can add ld6--3 to the spell's save DC. Unlike with damage rolls, the minimum result is not 1; for example, if you roll a 2 on the 1d6, the DC is reduced by 1. This choice is made at the time of casting, and has no effect on a spell that does not allow a save. The adjusted save DC is the same for all creatures that must save against the spell (you don't roll separately for each affected creature). By focusing the perfect order of Daanvi, you can choose to set the result of any spell's variable, numeric effect as one-half the maximum possible result. For example, a 9th-level wizard who casts fireball normally deals 9d6 points of damage; choosing to use this ability means the fireball deals 27 points of damage (half of 54, which is the maximum result of 9d6). The spell can still be affected by Empower Spell and other such feats and effects that require it to have a variable, numeric effect (using the previous example, empowering the fireball would cause it to deal 150% of 27 points of damage, or 40 points of damage, as if the result of the variable, numeric effect were 27).",

You can apply the effect of different metamagic feats to different spells, as long as you know all metamagic feats applied and you have suffi cient essentia capacity to do so. For example, you could invest 1 point of essentia to enlarge a spell (as Enlarge Spell) and 2 points of essentia to empower a spell (as Empower Spell), as long as you had at least 3 points of essentia to invest, had an essentia capacity (see Table 2-1: Essentia Capacity) of 3 or greater, and knew both the Empower Spell and Enlarge Spell feats.

    "benefit": "This feat expands the way you can use the Search skill by allowing you to notice and analyze available clues in a specifi c area. This use of the Search skill is a fullround action. Clues are pieces of evidence that lead to the solution of a mystery. Clues are physical and can be seen, heard, touched, smelled, or tasted. A clue stands out because it's not a normal feature of the area being searched. Examples of clues include a trampled f lowerbed, a broken urn, a pin snapped off in a lock, a torn strip of cloak, a burnt scrap of scroll, or a brooch clutched in a dead man's fi st. Add the following task to the list provided in the Player's Handbook description of the Search skill. Task Search DC. Find a clue 10. So, in addition to using Search to fi nd a certain item, notice a secret door, or fi nd a footprint, you have the additional training and experience necessary to fi nd clues of all sorts. Modify the Search DC according to the nature of the scene being examined, as indicated below. (This function of the Search skill doesn't reveal clues when there are no clues to fi nd.) Scene Condition Search DC Modifi er Undisturbed +0. (The scene has not been touched or contaminated in any way.) Disturbed +5. (Someone or something has slightly and perhaps unintentionally contaminated the scene; for example, a book was picked up and put back or a guard walked cautiously across the area.) Greatly disturbed +10. (Someone or something has massively and intentionally contaminated the scene; for example, the area has been cleaned and scrubbed, or the area was intentionally disturbed after the primary event occurred.) When a successful Search check turns up a clue, you can make a second check to discern patterns, analyze evidence, and draw conclusions about what occurred in a specifi c area. In other words, the fi rst Search check lets you fi nd something, and the second check allows you to fi gure out what you've found. You can make a DC 15 Search check to analyze a clue. By examining a body, you might determine whether the victim fought back or provided no struggle at all, or if claws, a weapon, or a spell killed the victim. By looking at a scorch mark on a wall, you might approximate the location of the spellcaster when the spell was cast. The DC for the check is modifi ed by the time that has elapsed since the event occurred and how signifi cant the clue is, as indicated below. All other rules concerning the Search skill otherwise apply. Circumstance (example) DC Modifi er Each day past since event +2. (Maximum modifier +10) Minor clue +0. (Provides only a piece of the solution to a puzzle and requires additional data for the investigator to reach a conclusion.) Moderate clue +2. (Provides signifi cant data toward the solution of a puzzle and could lead to a conclusion without additional data.) Major clue +5. (Provides everything an investigator needs to solve a puzzle, even if the solution isn't immediately obvious.) The DM should secretly make the second Search check to analyze a clue. If the check succeeds, the DM provides a truthful, objective analysis of the clue that can help the investigator reach a reasonable and logical conclusion. For example, analyzing a brooch clutched in the hand of a murdered dwarf (a major clue) reveals that it was torn from a blue cloak or tunic (it bears strands of a blue material). It bears the symbol of House Cannith, but the brooch isn't of the quality that a house noble would normally wear. These true and objective facts are now left for the investigator to consider and follow up on. If the check fails, the DM provides analysis of the clue that sounds plausible but is actually fl awed in some manner. For example, a fl awed analysis of the major clue discussed above would reveal only that the brooch bears the symbol of House Cannith. Even a successful analysis won't reveal the actual authenticity of a clue. False clues planted at a scene could provide truthful and objective data that leads an investigator in the wrong direction. Generally, investigating a scene a second time doesn't add new insight unless another clue is discovered. You can take 10 when making a Search check to fi nd a clue, but you can't take 20. Synergy: If you have 5 or more ranks in an appropriate Knowledge skill, you get a +2 bonus on Search checks to fi nd or analyze clues.",

You get a +1 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance for these schools and spells. The Shadow Weave proves less than optimal for effects involving energy or matter. Your effective caster level for spells you cast from the schools of Evocation or Transmutation (except spells with the darkness descriptor) is reduced by one.

You can no longer cast spells with the light descriptor, no matter _ what your level is. Such spells automatically fail. Your ability to use magic items that produce light effects is also limited--you cannot invoke an item's light power if the item's activation method is spell trigger or spell completion.

You can, however, strike a deal with Shar, the goddess who holds sway over the Shadow Weave, to regain your lost Wisdom. You must receive an atonement spell from a cleric of Shar. Sharran clerics require the subject to complete a dangerous quest before receiving the atonement, and afterward you must choose her as your patron.

Hit Dice: A stitched fl esh familiar has a d12 Hit Die and gains no bonus hit points from Constitution (since it is an undead creature). For effects that depend upon Hit Dice, use the master's character level or the familiar's normal Hit Dice total, whichever is higher. Hit Points: Use 1/2 the master's total or the familiar's normal total, whichever is higher. Attacks: Use the master's base attack bonus or the familiar's, whichever is higher. Saving Throws: For each saving throw, use either the familiar's base save bonus or the master's (as calculated from his character level), whichever is higher. Familiar Special Abilities: Use the second table in the Familiars sidebar on page 52 of the Player's Handbook to determine additional abilities, just as you would for a normal familiar.

The target experiences all the effects of both powers individually and receives a saving throw (if applicable) for each.

A spell whose effects wouldn't stack if it was cast twice under normal circumstances will create redundant effects if successfully twinned (see Combining Magical Effects, page 171 of the Player's Handbook). For example, a twinned charm person doesn't create a more potent or long-lasting effect, but any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts in order to free the target from the charm. As with other metamagic feats, twinning a spell does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling, so a single successful counterspell negates both instances of a twinned spell.

For example, if Hennet the 10th-level sorcerer casts magic missile, then activates a wand of magic missile (caster level 5th) in the next round, he can treat the wand's magic missile as if he had cast it (giving him a greater range, number of missiles, and so forth). Lingering Metamagic: If you cast a spell affected by one or more metamagic feats, and then cast the same spell in the next round, you can apply any one of the metamagic effects from the first casting to the second casting, but without any change to the spell's level. The second spell doesn't count as being affected by a metamagic feat for the purpose of this benefit (that is, it doesn't entitle you to apply the metamagic feat to a spell you might cast in the following round). Only spells you cast using your own metamagic feats (as opposed to metamagic effects from magic items) allow this option to function. For example, if Hennet uses a 5th-level slot to cast an empowered lightning bolt, in the next round he can use a 3rdlevel slot to cast another empowered lightning bolt.

    "benefit": "When you select this feat, you gain all the benefits described in this section for being an apprentice. \n\nh4. Apprenticeship\n\nOnce a character has taken the Apprentice feat, she is considered an apprentice. The first thing she must do is select a type of mentor; the mentor choices are listed below. The DM can create new mentor types using the listed mentors as guidelines.  Upon becoming an apprentice, a character immediately gains two new class skills and two bonus skill points to spend on these class skills.\n\nThese new class skills are added to the class skill list for any character class or prestige class she gains. The specific skills gained as class skills depend on the type of mentor she selects.A character immediately gains two new class skills and two bonus skill points to spend on these class skills. These new class skills are added to the class skill list for any character class or prestige class she gains. The specific skills gained as class skills depend on the type of mentor she selects.\n\nIn addition, the character gains one specific benefit (the exact type depends on the type of mentor selected) from her mentor, and in desperate times she can even call upon him for aid. Apprentices are expected to learn and grow, and mentors are loath to step in and provide physical support or financial aid, or to pull strings for an apprentice. Convincing the mentor to aid in this way requires a successful level check (d20 + character level), the DC of which is set by the DM and varies from 10 for simple favors to as high as 25 for highly dangerous, expensive, or illegal favors. A successful check means the mentor helps in some way (lends a magic item, accompanies the character on a short mission, pulls strings to get an appointment with the mayor, and so on) but demands double the normal tithe the next time the character gain a level. Once the character asks for aid, no further requests for aid will be honored until she gains at least one experience level.  \n\nh4. Finding a Mentor\n \nWhen a character decides to become an apprentice, she must first locate an appropriate mentor. Not just any NPC will do. As with the Leadership feat, apprenticeship depends heavily on the social setting of the campaign,the actual location of the PC, and the group dynamics. You're free to disallow this feat if it would disrupt the campaign. Unlike Leadership, the allied NPC does not travel with the PCs, so he or she won't take treasure, XP, and spotlight time from the player characters. A character can try to gain a mentor of a particular race, class, and alignment, but the actual details are left to the DM. If a character selects a mentor who is too different from her skill set, interests, or goals, the advantages of this feat are correspondingly diminished. The mentor has gear as an NPC (see Table4--23: NPC Gear Value,page 127 of the Dungeon Master'sGuide) and must have the \"Mentor\":feats/dungeon-masters-guide-ii--40/mentor--3267/ feat. \n\nh4. Expectations of the Apprentice\n\nMaintaining the status of apprentice isn't cheap. The apprentice is expected to tithe 100 gp of her earnings each time she gains a level. This tithe covers costs such as supplies, guild dues, gifts to the mentor, and miscellaneous costs. The tithe must be paid to the mentor as soon as possible (and certainly before the character gains another level), or she risks losing her apprenticeship.\n\nAdditionally, an apprentice is expected to practice her skills, study, and even undertake minor tasks for her mentor. Every week, she must spend at least 8 contiguous hours working for her mentor and practicing her skills. If she fails to meet this requirement, she must spend an additional day the next week.  If she shirks her duties in this manner for an entire month, the character's mentor expels her from the apprenticeship.\n\nh4. Mentor Types\n\nThe eight mentor types described below are fairly generic, and can encompass any alignment, race, or class. A mentor can easily be a chaotic evil gnome wizard craftsman or a lawful good human rogue, for example.\n\nEach mentor type is associated with two skills; as detailed above, the apprentice gains these skills as class skills. In addition, each mentor grants the apprentice additional benefits unique to his profession and calling.\n\n*Craftsman:* A craftsman mentor is skilled at building things. A craftsman grants his apprentice a +2 competence bonus on all Craft checks and a 10% discount when he purchases raw materials for items he makes (including items made with the \"Craft\":skills/craft/ skill or with an item creation feat, but not spell components or services).\n\n_Associated Skills:_ \"Appraise\":skills/appraise/, \"Knowledge (architecture and engineering)\":skills/knowledge-architecture-and-engineering/.\n\n*Criminal:* A criminal mentor is a high-ranking memberof a thieves' guild, an assassin, a bandit lord, or any similar miscreant. A criminal grants his apprentice a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks and an extra 100 gp to spend on equipment as a starting character at 1st level. In addition, the apprentice is not required to pay the 100 gp tithe at each level, provided he remains an apprentice in good standing. He is expected to comply with requests from his mentor for minor services or tasks, such as tailing a subject, staking out a prospective work site, and so on.\n \n_Associated Skills:_ \"Bluff\":skills/bluff/, \"Gather Information\":skills/gather-information/.\n\n*Entertainer:* An entertainer mentor is an actor, musician, storyteller, or other notable personality, often someone quite recognizable or famous. An entertainer grants her apprentice a +2 competence bonus on  diplomacy checks and the ability to call upon the aid of an admirer or fan by spending a tithe appropriate for the apprentice's level. The admirer is of a character level equal to 1/2 the apprentice's own (minimum 1st) and must be within at least one step of his alignment, but can be of any race or class. The ally serves the apprentice for a limited duration (usually a number of days equal to his Charisma modifier, minimum of 1 day) as if a cohort. Once the apprentice calls upon the aid of an admirer, he may not do so again until he gains at least one level.\n\n_Associated Skills:_ \"Diplomacy\":skills/diplomacy/, \"Perform\":skills/perform/. \n\n*Martial Artist:* A martial artist mentor has perfected a particular style of fighting, often exotic. A martial artist grants his apprentice a +2 competence bonus on \"Intimidate\":skills/intimidate/ checks and a +2 bonus on Reflex saving throws.\n \n_Associated Skills:_ \"Concentration\":skills/concentration/, \"Tumble\":skills/tumble/.\n\n*Philosopher:* A philosopher mentor is dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. In a civilized area he might be a scholar or librarian, while in the wilderness he might be a shaman or nomad. A philosopher grants his apprentice a +2 competence bonus on \"Concentration\":skills/concentration/ checks and a +2 bonus on Will saving throws.\n\n_Associated Skills:_ \"Knowledge (any one)\":skills/knowledge/, \"Sense Motive\":skills/sense-motive/.\n \n*Soldier:* A soldier mentor is a commander of an army, a captain of a garrison, a mercenary leader, or otherwise in command of a combat troop. A soldier grants his apprentice a +2 competence bonus on \"Intimidate\":skills/intimidate/ checks and a +2 bonus on Fortitude saving throws. \n\n_Associated Skills:_ \"Intimidate\":skills/intimidate/, \"Knowledge (local)\":skills/knowledge-local/. \n\n*Spellcaster:* A spellcaster mentor could be a priest of the character's religion, a teacher at a wizard's guild, or an inventor seeking a prot�g�. Spellcaster mentors are not as useful as the other seven mentors for characters who cannot cast spells themselves. A spellcaster grants her apprentice a +2 competence bonus on Spellcraft checks. The tutelage of a spellcasting mentor grants additional benefits only if the apprentice shares the same class as his mentor. The apprentice only gains these benefits when he gains a level in this class; he retains all the other benefits of this feat (the bonus skills and the bonus on \"Spellcraft\":skills/spellcraft/ checks) regardless of what class he chooses to gain a level in.\n\nIf the apprentice and his mentor are arcane spellcasters, he gains one additional spell known at 1st level. \"Wizards\":classes/wizard/ gain this spell in their spellbooks, and spontaneous casters such as \"sorcerers\":classes/sorcerer/ or \"bards\":classes/bard/ gain an additional 1st-level spell beyond their normal number of spells known. As the apprentice gains levels, he is able to learn additional spellcasting techniques from his mentor; wizards can copy from their mentor's spellbook at no charge. Spellcasters who do not prepare spells (such as a \"bard\":classes/bard/ or \"sorcerer\":classes/sorcerer/) gain increased flexibility with the spells they know. Each time an apprentice gains another of these levels, he can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. If the character and his mentor are divine spellcasters who prepare spells (such as \"clerics\":classes/cleric/, \"druids\":classes/druid/, \"paladins\":classes/paladin/, or \"rangers\":classes/paladin/), he can select one spell he knows as a preferred spell. This can be a spell of any level he can cast. Once per day, the apprentice can spontaneously cast a preferred spell by swapping out any prepared spell of an equal spell level. He can only have one preferred spell at a time, but each time he gains a level in the associated class, he can change his preferred spell to a different spell. \n\n_Associated Skills:_ \"Knowledge (any one)\":skills/knowledge/, \"Use Magic Device\":use-magic-device/.\n \n*Woodsman:* A woodsman mentor might be a hunter, a caretaker of a forest, or a scout. A woodsman mentor grants his apprentice a +2 competence bonus on Survival checks and the ability to follow tracks as if the apprentice had the \"Track\":feats/players-handbook-v35--6/track--2952/ feat, but only when the DC is 20 or lower.\n \n_Associated Skills:_ \"Knowledge (nature)\":skills/knowledge-nature/, \"Survival\":skills/survival/.\n\nh4. Mentor Statistics\n\nThe DM should develop the mentor's statistics. A mentor has a base level of 5th, modified by the apprentice's Charisma bonus (if any) and by the following situations. These situations only apply when the feat is first taken; if any of these situations change at a later date (for example, the apprentice's alignment changes), the mentor's level does not change.\n\n|_. Condition |_. Modifier |\n| Mentor and apprentice are same race and class | +1 |\n| Mentor and apprentice are same alignment | +2 |\n| Mentor and apprentice share one alignment aspect | +1 |\n| Mentor and apprentice are opposing alignments | --1 |\n| Apprentice starts at maximum rank in at least two of the mentor's associated skills | +1 |",

A successful check means the mentor helps in some way (lends a magic item, accompanies the character on a short mission, pulls strings to get an appointment with the mayor, and so on) but demands double the normal tithe the next time the character gain a level. Once the character asks for aid, no further requests for aid will be honored until she gains at least one experience level.  </p>\n\n\t<h4>Finding a Mentor</h4>\n\n\t<p>When a character decides to become an apprentice, she must first locate an appropriate mentor. Not just any <span class=\"caps\">NPC</span> will do. As with the Leadership feat, apprenticeship depends heavily on the social setting of the campaign,the actual location of the PC, and the group dynamics. You&#39;re free to disallow this feat if it would disrupt the campaign. Unlike Leadership, the allied <span class=\"caps\">NPC</span> does not travel with the PCs, so he or she won&#39;t take treasure, XP, and spotlight time from the player characters. A character can try to gain a mentor of a particular race, class, and alignment, but the actual details are left to the DM. If a character selects a mentor who is too different from her skill set, interests, or goals, the advantages of this feat are correspondingly diminished. The mentor has gear as an <span class=\"caps\">NPC</span> (see Table4&#8212;23: <span class=\"caps\">NPC</span> Gear Value,page 127 of the Dungeon Master&#39;sGuide) and must have the <a href=\"/feats/dungeon-masters-guide-ii--40/mentor--3267/\">Mentor</a> feat. </p>\n\n\t<h4>Expectations of the Apprentice</h4>\n\n\t<p>Maintaining the status of apprentice isn&#39;t cheap. The apprentice is expected to tithe 100 gp of her earnings each time she gains a level. This tithe covers costs such as supplies, guild dues, gifts to the mentor, and miscellaneous costs. The tithe must be paid to the mentor as soon as possible (and certainly before the character gains another level), or she risks losing her apprenticeship.</p>\n\n\t<p>Additionally, an apprentice is expected to practice her skills, study, and even undertake minor tasks for her mentor. Every week, she must spend at least 8 contiguous hours working for her mentor and practicing her skills. If she fails to meet this requirement, she must spend an additional day the next week.  If she shirks her duties in this manner for an entire month, the character&#39;s mentor expels her from the apprenticeship.</p>\n\n\t<h4>Mentor Types</h4>\n\n\t<p>The eight mentor types described below are fairly generic, and can encompass any alignment, race, or class. A mentor can easily be a chaotic evil gnome wizard craftsman or a lawful good human rogue, for example.</p>\n\n\t<p>Each mentor type is associated with two skills; as detailed above, the apprentice gains these skills as class skills. In addition, each mentor grants the apprentice additional benefits unique to his profession and calling.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Craftsman:</strong> A craftsman mentor is skilled at building things. A craftsman grants his apprentice a +2 competence bonus on all Craft checks and a 10% discount when he purchases raw materials for items he makes (including items made with the <a href=\"/skills/craft/\">Craft</a> skill or with an item creation feat, but not spell components or services).</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Associated Skills:</em> <a href=\"/skills/appraise/\">Appraise</a>, <a href=\"/skills/knowledge-architecture-and-engineering/\">Knowledge (architecture and engineering)</a>.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Criminal:</strong> A criminal mentor is a high-ranking memberof a thieves&#39; guild, an assassin, a bandit lord, or any similar miscreant. A criminal grants his apprentice a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks and an extra 100 gp to spend on equipment as a starting character at 1st level. In addition, the apprentice is not required to pay the 100 gp tithe at each level, provided he remains an apprentice in good standing. He is expected to comply with requests from his mentor for minor services or tasks, such as tailing a subject, staking out a prospective work site, and so on.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Associated Skills:</em> <a href=\"/skills/bluff/\">Bluff</a>, <a href=\"/skills/gather-information/\">Gather Information</a>.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Entertainer:</strong> An entertainer mentor is an actor, musician, storyteller, or other notable personality, often someone quite recognizable or famous. An entertainer grants her apprentice a +2 competence bonus on  diplomacy checks and the ability to call upon the aid of an admirer or fan by spending a tithe appropriate for the apprentice&#39;s level. The admirer is of a character level equal to 1/2 the apprentice&#39;s own (minimum 1st) and must be within at least one step of his alignment, but can be of any race or class. The ally serves the apprentice for a limited duration (usually a number of days equal to his Charisma modifier, minimum of 1 day) as if a cohort. Once the apprentice calls upon the aid of an admirer, he may not do so again until he gains at least one level.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Associated Skills:</em> <a href=\"/skills/diplomacy/\">Diplomacy</a>, <a href=\"/skills/perform/\">Perform</a>. </p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Martial Artist:</strong> A martial artist mentor has perfected a particular style of fighting, often exotic. A martial artist grants his apprentice a +2 competence bonus on <a href=\"/skills/intimidate/\">Intimidate</a> checks and a +2 bonus on Reflex saving throws.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Associated Skills:</em> <a href=\"/skills/concentration/\">Concentration</a>, <a href=\"/skills/tumble/\">Tumble</a>.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Philosopher:</strong> A philosopher mentor is dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. In a civilized area he might be a scholar or librarian, while in the wilderness he might be a shaman or nomad. A philosopher grants his apprentice a +2 competence bonus on <a href=\"/skills/concentration/\">Concentration</a> checks and a +2 bonus on Will saving throws.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Associated Skills:</em> <a href=\"/skills/knowledge/\">Knowledge (any one)</a>, <a href=\"/skills/sense-motive/\">Sense Motive</a>.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Soldier:</strong> A soldier mentor is a commander of an army, a captain of a garrison, a mercenary leader, or otherwise in command of a combat troop. A soldier grants his apprentice a +2 competence bonus on <a href=\"/skills/intimidate/\">Intimidate</a> checks and a +2 bonus on Fortitude saving throws. </p>\n\n\t<p><em>Associated Skills:</em> <a href=\"/skills/intimidate/\">Intimidate</a>, <a href=\"/skills/knowledge-local/\">Knowledge (local)</a>. </p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Spellcaster:</strong> A spellcaster mentor could be a priest of the character&#39;s religion, a teacher at a wizard&#39;s guild, or an inventor seeking a prot�g�. Spellcaster mentors are not as useful as the other seven mentors for characters who cannot cast spells themselves. A spellcaster grants her apprentice a +2 competence bonus on Spellcraft checks. The tutelage of a spellcasting mentor grants additional benefits only if the apprentice shares the same class as his mentor. The apprentice only gains these benefits when he gains a level in this class; he retains all the other benefits of this feat (the bonus skills and the bonus on <a href=\"/skills/spellcraft/\">Spellcraft</a> checks) regardless of what class he chooses to gain a level in.</p>\n\n\t<p>If the apprentice and his mentor are arcane spellcasters, he gains one additional spell known at 1st level. <a href=\"/classes/wizard/\">Wizards</a> gain this spell in their spellbooks, and spontaneous casters such as <a href=\"/classes/sorcerer/\">sorcerers</a> or <a href=\"/classes/bard/\">bards</a> gain an additional 1st-level spell beyond their normal number of spells known. As the apprentice gains levels, he is able to learn additional spellcasting techniques from his mentor; wizards can copy from their mentor&#39;s spellbook at no charge. Spellcasters who do not prepare spells (such as a <a href=\"/classes/bard/\">bard</a> or <a href=\"/classes/sorcerer/\">sorcerer</a>) gain increased flexibility with the spells they know. Each time an apprentice gains another of these levels, he can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. The new spell&#39;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. If the character and his mentor are divine spellcasters who prepare spells (such as <a href=\"/classes/cleric/\">clerics</a>, <a href=\"/classes/druid/\">druids</a>, <a href=\"/classes/paladin/\">paladins</a>, or <a href=\"/classes/paladin/\">rangers</a>), he can select one spell he knows as a preferred spell. This can be a spell of any level he can cast. Once per day, the apprentice can spontaneously cast a preferred spell by swapping out any prepared spell of an equal spell level. He can only have one preferred spell at a time, but each time he gains a level in the associated class, he can change his preferred spell to a different spell. </p>\n\n\t<p><em>Associated Skills:</em> <a href=\"/skills/knowledge/\">Knowledge (any one)</a>, <a href=\"/use-magic-device/\">Use Magic Device</a>.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Woodsman:</strong> A woodsman mentor might be a hunter, a caretaker of a forest, or a scout. A woodsman mentor grants his apprentice a +2 competence bonus on Survival checks and the ability to follow tracks as if the apprentice had the <a href=\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/track--2952/\">Track</a> feat, but only when the DC is 20 or lower.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Associated Skills:</em> <a href=\"/skills/knowledge-nature/\">Knowledge (nature)</a>, <a href=\"/skills/survival/\">Survival</a>.</p>\n\n\t<h4>Mentor Statistics</h4>\n\n\t<p>The DM should develop the mentor&#39;s statistics. A mentor has a base level of 5th, modified by the apprentice&#39;s Charisma bonus (if any) and by the following situations. These situations only apply when the feat is first taken; if any of these situations change at a later date (for example, the apprentice&#39;s alignment changes), the mentor&#39;s level does not change.</p>\n\n\t<table>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Condition </th>\n\t\t\t<th>Modifier </th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> Mentor and apprentice are same race and class </td>\n\t\t\t<td> +1 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> Mentor and apprentice are same alignment </td>\n\t\t\t<td> +2 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> Mentor and apprentice share one alignment aspect </td>\n\t\t\t<td> +1 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> Mentor and apprentice are opposing alignments </td>\n\t\t\t<td> &#8212;1 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> Apprentice starts at maximum rank in at least two of the mentor&#39;s associated skills </td>\n\t\t\t<td> +1 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</table>",

Stair King: To use this maneuver, you must gain the high ground bonus on your attacks against an opponent. If you hit your foe with two or more melee attacks during your turn, he must make a Balance check (DC 10 + your Str modifier) or be knocked prone. Your opponent can opt to succeed automatically on his Balance check. If he does so, he will lose his move action on his next turn, but he will Succeed automatically on Balance checks to resist this maneuver until the start of his next turn. Your opponent must make this choice before seeing the result of his Balance check. You can target a particular creature with this maneuver once per round. Tunnel Fighter.- To use this maneuver, you must be the target of at least one melee attack from at least one foe while standing with walls adjacent to you on two or more sides. When you are attacked under such conditions, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class due to cover. (If you gain cover from another source, this benefit does not stack with it.) You also block line of sight for any spells or attacks made by your opponents, though your allies can fire through your space as normal. Door Sentinel: To use this maneuver, you must fight defensively while adjacent to or standing in a doorway, a gate, or a similar opening in a wall. You must be adjacent to or standing in each square across the doorway's width. For 1 round after you fight defensively, you gain a +4 bonus on Strength or Dexterity checks to resist bull rush or trip attacks.

Creating a tattoo takes 1 hour, and it must be inked onto a creature with a corporeal body. When you create a tattoo, you set the caster level. The caster level must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a tattoo is its spell level × its caster level × 50 gp. To create a tattoo, you must spend 1/25th of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half this base price. When you create a tattoo, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. The bearer of the tattoo is the only one who can activate it and is always the target of the spell. Activating a tattoo requires the creature to touch the tattoo with either hand (the hand does not need to be empty). Activating a tattoo is a standard action that does not draw an attack of opportunity. Any tattoo that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the tattoo. Normally, a magic tattoo uses a magic item space on the creature's body. For example, a creature with a tattoo on one of its hands could not gain the benefit from a magic glove on that hand. Likewise, a creature with a magic tattoo on its back does not receive the benefits of a magic cloak, cape, or mantle. In effect, the magic tattoo is always the first item \"worn\" on that part of the body, negating the effects of all other items. A tattoo can be created that does not use a magic item space, but the base price of such a tattoo is double the normal value. A magic tattoo can be erased with an erase spell as if it were magic writing. Failing to erase the tattoo does not activate it.

Also, when you use fascinate, suggestion, or mass suggestion, the saving throw DC increases by 1. If you have the Haunting Melody feat, the saving throw DC for that effect also increases by 1. If you have the Music of Growth feat, the bonus bestowed by that feat increases to +6. If you have the Music of Making feat, the bonus on Craft checks bestowed by that feat increases to +6.

It allows you to use a Knowledge skill to navigate a library, an offi ce fi ling system, a chronicler's repository, or a church's records storage cell in order to discover information. You must be able to read the language the texts are written in to research them. Research a Topic: Given enough time (usually 1d4 hours, though the DM can increase the time based on the amount of material you're examining) and a successful DC 10 skill check, you gain a general understanding of the topic you're researching. This assumes the information you are seeking exists within the collection of materials you are researching. The higher the check result, the better and more detailed the information (to the extent available within the source material). When you want to fi nd out specifi c information on a specifi c topic, you must fi rst fi nd a library with tomes relating to that topic. The quality of the library or collection can provide a circumstance bonus on your Knowledge check when performing research. General-purpose libraries (such as those found in some wealthy households, small churches, or towns) contain basic information on a variety of topics and provide a +1 circumstance bonus. A library devoted to a specifi c topic (usually owned by churches or organizations devoted to specifi c pursuits) provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Knowledge checks related to its topic. Comprehensive collections are harder to fi nd, but they provide a +4 circumstance bonus. Such collections reside with large churches, in some larger cities, in some organizations and institutions, at Morgrave University, and in major chronicle offi ces. Even rarer and harder to gain access to are master collections, which provide a +6 circumstance bonus. Master collections are found in a few dragonmarked house enclaves, one or two royal libraries, and in the library at Korranberg. Examine Records: Examining books or records to get a general sense of what's in them takes time, skill, and some luck. Find a stack of ledgers in the alchemist's lab? Discover records in the crime lord's hideout? Locate the fi les pertaining to taxes collected in the city? To get a general sense of the information contained therein and whether or not you can use it, you must make a research check using the most appropriate Knowledge skill. The DC depends on the complexity of the code or fi ling system used. Complexity. - knowledge - Time. of Code ----- DC ----------- Needed. Basic ------- 10 ------------ 1d4 hours. Simple ------ 15 ------------ 1d4+1 hours. Moderate --- 20 ----------- 1d4+2 hours. Complex ---- 30 ----------- 1d4+4 hours. On any successful check, the higher the result, the better and more complete the information you glean. If you start out seeking a specific fact, date, map, or similar bit of information, the DM might increase the DC by as little as +5 or as much as +15. You can retry a Knowledge check made to perform research, though if the material you are examining doesn't contain the data you seek, you can't find it. You can take 10 or take 20 when making a Knowledge check to research a topic or examine records. This use of the Knowledge skill takes a minimum of 1d4 hours.",

On the round after the charge, you can fl utter your wings in a distracting manner while you make a melee attack or attacks against the same opponent you charged. If that opponent fails a DC 20 Refl ex save, you gain a +2 bonus for your turn on your melee attack rolls against the distracted opponent. You cannot make a wing buffet again until after you make another charge. Wing Defense: To use this maneuver, you must have taken the total defense action. On the round after doing so, if you do not use your wings to fl y, you can fl utter your wings in such a way as to gain concealment for the round. Wing Fan: To use this maneuver, you must have used at least one move action in the previous round to fl y or glide at least 30 feet. As a full-round action in the next round, you can use your wings to produce an effect identical to a gust of wind spell with a range of 30 feet. Using this maneuver makes you fatigued. You cannot use this maneuver if you are exhausted.",

This ability allows the shifter to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. A wildhunt shifter can identify familiar odors just as a human does familiar sights. A wildhunt shifter can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. These stronger scents block other scents, so they can sometimes be used to confuse or hamper this shifter trait. When a wildhunt shifter detects a scent, the exact location of the source i sn't rev ealed--only i ts presence somewhere within range. The shifter can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever the shifter comes within 5 feet of the source, she pinpoints the source's location. While shifting, a wildhunt shifter who has the Track feat can follow tracks by smell, making Survival checks to fi nd or follow a trail.

You may carry enough food to sustain you for one day in a simple (nonmagic) sack or bag. You may carry and use a spell component pouch. You may not use any magic item of any sort, though you can benefit from magic items used on your behalf--you can drink a potion of cure serious wounds a friend gives you, receive a spell cast from a wand, scroll, or staff, or ride on your companion's ebony fly. You may not, however, \"borrow\" a cloak of resistance or any other magic item from a companion for even a single round, nor may you yourself cast a spell from a scroll, wand, or staff.

Unlike the other benefits of a vow of poverty, a character does not gain these bonus feats retroactively when he takes the Vow of Poverty feat; he only gains those bonus feats that apply for the levels he gains after swearing his vow. Thus, the bonus feat gained at 1st level is available only to humans who take both Sacred Vow and Vow of Poverty at 1st level. \n\n*Endure Elements (Ex):* A 3rd-level ascetic is immune to the effects of being in a hot or cold environment. He can exist comfortably in conditions between -50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves (as described in the Dungeon Master's Guide). \n\n*Exalted Strike (Su):* At 4th level, an ascetic gains a +1 enhancement bonus on all his attack and damage rolls. In effect, any weapon the character wields becomes a +1 magic weapon, and can overcome the damage reduction of a creature as though it were a magic weapon. This enhancement bonus rises to +2 at 10th level, to +3 at 14th level, to +4 at 17th level, and to +5 at 20th level. At 10th level, any weapon damage the character deals is also considered to be good-aligned, so that it can bypass the damage reductions of some evil outsiders.\n\n*Sustenance (Ex):* At 5th-level ascetic doesn't need to eat or drink. \n\n*Deflection (Su):* A 6th-level ascetic receives a +1 deflection bonus to his Armor Class. This bonus increases to +2 at 12th level, and to +3 at 18th level. \n\n*Resistance (Ex):* At 7th level, an ascetic gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases to +2 at 13th level, and to +3 at 17th level. \n\n*Ability Score Enhancement (Ex):* At 7th level, an ascetic gains a +2 enhancement bonus to one ability score. At 11th level, he gains an extra +2 bonus to that score, and a +2 bonus to another ability score. At 15th level, he gains an extra +2 bonus to those two scores, and a +2 bonus to a third ability score. At 19th level, he gains an extra +2 bonus to those three scores, and a +2 bonus to a fourth ability score. \n\n*Natural Armor (Ex):* At 8th level, an ascetic gains a +1 natural armor bonus, or his existing natural armor bonus increases by +1. It increases an extra +1 at 16th level. \n\n*Mind Shielding (Ex):* Also at 8th level, an ascetic character becomes immune to detect thoughts, discern lies, and any attempt to discern his alignment. \n\n*Damage Reduction (Su):* An ascetic gains damage reduction 5/magic at 10th level. At 15th level, this improves to 5/evil, and at 19th level to 10/evil. \n\n*Greater Sustenance (Ex):* Once he attains 12th level, an ascetic character doesn't need to breathe. \n\n*Energy Resistance (Ex):* At 13th level, an ascetic gains resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic energy. At 20th level, this increases to resistance 15. \n\n*Freedom of Movement (Ex):* At 14th level, an ascetic can act as if continually under the effect of a \"_freedom of movement_\":/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/freedom-of-movement--2322/ spell. \n\n*Regeneration (Ex):* At 17th level, an ascetic heals 1 point of damage per level per hour rather than every day. (This ability cannot be aided by the Heal skill.) Nonlethal damage heals at a rate of 1 point of damage per level every 5 minutes. \n\n*True Seeing (Su):* At 18th level, an ascetic gains a continuous \"_true seeing_\":/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/true-seeing--2520/ ability, as the spell. \n\nh4. Other Ramifications of Poverty\n\nA character who has forsaken material possessions may find himself at a marked disadvantage when it comes to certain necessary expenses, such as expensive material components. One option is for ascetic characters to beg components from other party members, who are probably gaining as much benefit from having the spell cast as the caster is. Alternatively, an ascetic spellcaster can sacrifice experience points in place of expensive components, with 1 XP equivalent to 5 gp value of components. \n\nHaving a character in the party who has taken a vow of poverty should not necessarily mean that the other party members get bigger shares of treasure! An ascetic character must be as extreme in works of charity as she is in self-denial. The majority of her share of party treasure (or the profits from the sale thereof) should be donated to the needy, either directly (equipping rescued captives with gear taken from their fallen captors) or indirectly (making a large donation to a temple noted for its work among the poor). While taking upon herself the burden of poverty voluntarily, an ascetic recognizes that many people do not have the freedom to choose poverty, but instead have it forced upon them, and seeks to better those unfortunates as much as possible. \n\n|_.

    "specialHtml": "\t<p>To fulfill your vow, you must not own or use any material possessions, with the following exceptions: You may carry and use ordinary (neither magic nor masterwork) simple weapons, usually just a quarterstaff that serves as a walking stick. You may wear simple clothes (usually just a homespun robe, possibly also including a hat and sandals) with no magical properties. You may carry enough food to sustain you for one day in a simple (nonmagic) sack or bag. You may carry and use a spell component pouch. You may not use any magic item of any sort, though you can benefit from magic items used on your behalf&#8212;you can drink a potion of cure serious wounds a friend gives you, receive a spell cast from a wand, scroll, or staff, or ride on your companion&#39;s ebony fly. You may not, however, &quot;borrow&quot; a cloak of resistance or any other magic item from a companion for even a single round, nor may you yourself cast a spell from a scroll, wand, or staff. If you break your vow, you immediately and irrevocably lose the benefit of this feat. You may not take another feat to replace it.</p>\n\n\t<h4>Vow of Poverty</h4>\n\n\t<p><strong>AC Bonus (Su):</strong> A 1st-level ascetic receives a +4 exalted bonus to his Armor Class. The bonus increases to +5 at 3rd level, and thereafter increases by +1 for each 3 character levels. This bonus does not apply to touch attacks and does not hinder incorporeal touch attacks. Brilliant energy weapons, however, do not ignore this bonus. This does not stack with an armor bonus. </p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Bonus Exalted Feats:</strong> At 1st level, an ascetic gets a bonus exalted feat, and another bonus feat at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter. Unlike the other benefits of a vow of poverty, a character does not gain these bonus feats retroactively when he takes the Vow of Poverty feat; he only gains those bonus feats that apply for the levels he gains after swearing his vow. Thus, the bonus feat gained at 1st level is available only to humans who take both Sacred Vow and Vow of Poverty at 1st level. </p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Endure Elements (Ex):</strong> A 3rd-level ascetic is immune to the effects of being in a hot or cold environment.
