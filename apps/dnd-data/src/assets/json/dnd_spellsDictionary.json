A stuck creature can break loose by spending 1 round and succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either from making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature can progress through the writhing blood vessels very slowly.

Like a homunculus, it is an extension of its creator, sharing the same alignment and link to nature. A bogun does not fight particularly well, but it can perform any simple action, such as attacking, carrying a message, or opening a door or window. For the most part, a bogun simply carries out its creator's instructions. Because it is self-aware and somewhat willful, however, its behavior is not entirely predictable. On rare occasions (5% of the time), a bogun might refuse to perform a particular task. In that case, the creator must make a DC 11 Diplomacy check to convince the creature to cooperate. Success means the bogun performs the task as requested; failure indicates that it either does exactly the opposite or refuses to do anything at all for 24 hours (DM's option as to which).</p>\n\n\t<p>A bogun cannot speak, but the process of creating one links it telepathically with its creator. It knows what its creator knows and can convey to him or her everything it sees and hears, up to a range of 500 yards. A bogun never travels beyond this range willingly, though it can be removed forcibly. In that case, it does everything in its power to regain contact with its creator. An attack that destroys a bogun also deals its creator 2d10 points of damage. If its creator is slain, a bogun also dies, and its body collapses into a heap of rotting vegetation.</p>\n\n\t<p>A bogun looks like a vaguely humanoid mound of compost. The creator determines its precise features, but a typical bogun stands about 18 inches tall and has a wingspan of about 2 feet. Its skin is covered with nettles and branches.</p>\n\n\t<p>Combat: A bogun attacks by brushing against opponents with harsh nettles that deliver an irritating poison. Construction: Unlike a homunculus, a bogun is created from natural materials available in any forest. Thus, there is no gold piece cost for its creation. All materials used become permanent parts of the bogun.</p>\n\n\t<p>The creator must be at least 7th level and possess the Craft Wondrous Item feat to make a bogun. Before casting any spells, the creator must weave a physical form out of living (or once-living) vegetable matter to hold the magical energy. A bit of the creator's own body, such as a few strands of hair or a drop of blood, must also be incorporated into this crude mannequin. The creator can assemble the body personally or hire someone else to do it. Creating this mannequin requires a DC 12 Craft (basketweaving or weaving) check.</p>\n\n\t<p>Once the body is finished, the creator must animate it through an extended magical ritual that requires a week to complete. The creator must labor for at least 8 hours each day in complete solitude in a forest grove; any interruption from another sentient creature undoes the magic. If the creator is personally weaving the creature's body, that process and the ritual can be performed together.</p>\n\n\t<p>When not actively working on the ritual, the creator must rest and can perform no other activities except eating, sleeping,or talking. Missing even one day causes the process to fail. At that point, the ritual must be started anew, though the previously crafted body and the grove can be reused.</p>\n\n\t<p>On the final day of the ritual, the creator must personally cast control plants, wood shape, and beget bogun. These spells can come from outside sources, such as scrolls, rather than being prepared, if the creator prefers.</p>",

You retain your own ability scores.  Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the same.</p>\n\n\t<p>You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack).  You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels (such as a barbarian's rage ability), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels (such as a dragon's frightful presence ability).</p>\n\n\t<p>If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally.  You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components.</p>\n\n\t<p>You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind.  Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth).  A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.</p>\n\n\t<p>You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and so forth.</p>\n\n\t<p>You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form.

The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind.  You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race.  If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.</p>\n\n\t<p>When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.  When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional.  Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held in the same way.

    "description": "<p>A binding spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature.<br>The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level.<br>You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell.<br>For each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by 1.<br>For each assistant who casts dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a binding spell.<br>Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant.<br>Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts.<br>All binding spells are dismissible.<br>Regardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur.<br>These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass.<br>The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.<br>Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify.<br>For example, a bound creature can be released when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.<br>Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed.<br>Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.<br>If you are casting any of the first three versions of binding (those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap.<br>If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw.<br>If the creature succeeds on this save, all the binding spells it has received are broken.<br>The binding spell has six versions.<br>Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.<br>Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you.<br>The duration is one year per caster level.<br>The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.<br>Slumber: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level.<br>The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age.<br>This form of binding is more difficult to cast than chaining, making it slightly easier to resist.<br>Reduce the spell's save DC by 1.<br>Bound Slumber: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as one month per caster level.<br>Reduce the save DC by 2.<br>Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area (such as a labyrinth) from which it cannot wander by any means.<br>The effect is permanent.<br>Reduce the save DC by 3.<br>Metamorphosis: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face.<br>It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose.<br>The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities.<br>The binding is permanent.<br>The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age.<br>Reduce the save DC by 4.<br>Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object.<br>The binding is permanent.<br>The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age.<br>Reduce the save DC by 4.<br>You can't dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a similar effect, though an antimagic field or Mordenkainen's disjunction affects it normally.<br>A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to dismissal, banishment, or a similar effect.<br>Components: The components for a binding spell vary according to the version of the spell, but they always include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or spellbook page containing the spell, somatic gestures, and materials appropriate to the form of binding used.<br>These components can include such items as miniature chains of special metals (silver for lycanthropes, cold iron for demons, and so forth), soporific herbs of the rarest sort (for slumber bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the like.<br>In addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of binding (cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.</p>",

No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level.

If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Skeletons:</em> A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones, so creating a skeleton from a purple worm, for example, is not possible. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. The statistics for a skeleton depend on its size; they do not depend on what abilities the creature may have had while alive.

The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.</p>\n\n\t<p>An antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. A hasted creature, for example, is not hasted while inside the field, but the spell resumes functioning when the creature leaves the field. Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration. </p>\n\n\t<p>Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations, such as create water, are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result). </p>\n\n\t<p>A normal creature (a normally encountered griffon rather than a conjured one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. Dispel magic does not remove the field.</p>\n\n\t<p>Two or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, prismatic sphere, and prismatic wall, remain unaffected by antimagic field (see the individual spell descriptions).

In a moment you're safe, and you gain a brief respite—time enough to cast more permanent protective spells.</em></p>\n\n\t<p>You gain a temporary respite from the natural effects of a specific plane. These effects include extremes in temperature, lack of air, poisonous fumes, emanations of positive or negative energy, or other attributes of the plane itself (<span class=\"caps\">DMG</span> 150).</p>\n\n\t<p>Avoid planar effects provides protection from the 3d10 points of fire damage that characters normally take when on a plane with the fire-dominant trait. Avoid planar effects allows a character to breathe water on a water-dominant plane and ignore the threat of suffocation on an earth-dominant plane. A character protected by avoid planar effects can't be blinded by the energy of a major positive-dominant plane and automatically stops gaining temporary hit points when they equal the character's full normal hit point total. Negative-dominant planes don't deal damage or bestow negative levels to characters protected by avoid planar effects.</p>\n\n\t<p>In addition, some effects specific to a plane are negated by avoid planar effects. In the D&amp;D cosmology, avoid planar effects negates the deafening effect of Pandemonium and the cold damage on the Cania layer of the Nine Hells. The DM can add additional protections for a cosmology he creates. If the campaign has an Elemental Plane of Cold, for example, avoid planar effects protects against the base cold damage dealt to everyone on the plane.</p>\n\n\t<p>The effects of gravity traits, alignment traits, and magic traits aren't negated by avoid planar effects, nor is the special entrapping trait of certain planes (such as Elysium and Hades).</p>\n\n\t<p>The spell does not provide protection against creatures, native or otherwise, nor does it protect against spells, special abilities, or extreme and nonnatural formations within the plane. This spell allows you to survive on the Elemental Plane of Earth, for instance, but it won't protect you if you walk into a pool of magma on that same plane.</p>",

Every time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area, it might step on one. The caltrops make one attack roll (+0 melee) against the creature. For this attack, the target 's shield and deflection bonuses do not count, nor does its armor bonus for armor worn. A target  wearing shoes or other footwear gains a +2 armor bonus to Armor Class (which does count). If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped on one.</p>\n\n\t<p>A successful attack by a caltrop deals 1 point of damage. If the target is Small, Medium, or Large, its land speed is reduced by one half because of the injury. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours,  until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.</p>\n\n\t<p>The DM judges the effectiveness of caltrops against unusual opponents or opponents outside the size range given above. A giant centipede, for example, can scramble among the caltrops with no chance of hurting itself, and a fire giant wearing thick, massive boots might be immune to their attacks.</p>\n\n\t<p>For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you can affect an additional 5-foot-by-5-foot square, and the caltrops' attack bonus increases by 1.

A moment of panic grips you as your chest ceases to expand and you realize you are no longer breathing. Cold sweeps over your body as you glance down at your now-metallic flesh.</em></p>\n\n\t<p>When you cast this spell, you assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a warforged titan (<span class=\"caps\">EBERRON</span> <em>Campaign Setting</em> 302). While under the effect of the spell, your creature type changes to construct, and your size changes to Huge. You have the space and reach of a warforged titan (15 feet/15 feet). Your mindset changes so that you relish combat and cannot cast spells, even from magic items. You gain the Strength and Dexterity of an average warforged titan (Str 28, Dex 8), but you retain your own mental ability scores. You have no Constitution score while affected by this spell. Your base land speed becomes 50 feet. You gain darkvision out to 60 feet. You also gain low-light vision.</p>\n\n\t<p>Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base saving throw bonuses all remain the same. You lose any extraordinary special abilities of your own form, as well as spell-like and supernatural abilities. You keep all extraordinary special attacks derived from class levels (such as a barbarian's rage or a rogue's sneak attack), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels. You cannot speak or cast spells while in warforged titan form. Your natural armor bonus becomes +18, regardless of any natural armor bonus from your normal form, and you gain damage reduction 10/adamantine.</p>\n\n\t<p>As a construct, you have the following qualities: immunity to all mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy effects, critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, energy drain, and to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless). You also gain the warforged titan's two attack forms (axe and maul), along with the trample special ability (damage 1d8+13; Reflex DC 25 half). The warforged titan's axe deals 2d8 points of slashing damage and has a Ã—3 critical modifier; its maul (essentially a huge warhammer) deals 2d8 points of bludgeoning damage and also has a Ã—3 critical modifier. Your equipment melds into your new form and becomes nonfunctional.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Material Component:</em> A miniature bronze hammer.</p>",

You must be able to communicate with the dragon to bargain for its services.</p>\n\n\t<p>The summoned dragon requires payment for its services, which takes the form of coins, gems, or other precious objects the dragon can add to its hoard. This payment must be made before the dragon agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.</p>\n\n\t<p>Tasks requiring up to 1 minute per caster level require a payment of 50 gp per HD of the called dragon. For a task requiring up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 250 fp per HD. Long-term tasks (those requiring up to 1 day per caster level) require a payment of 500 gp per HD).</p>\n\n\t<p>Especially hazardous tasks require a greater gift, up to twice the given amount. A dragon never accepts less than the indicated amount, even for a nonhazardous task.</p>\n\n\t<p>At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for elapses, the creature returns to the place it was called from (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).</p>\n\n\t<p><em>XP Cost:</em> 100 xp.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Special:</em> Sorcerers cast this spell at +1 caster level.</p>",

This spell affects only naturally occurring tunnels or worked tunnels that are surrounded on all sides by unworked, natural, subterranean earth.

A square-sided or rough tunnel can also be affected, as long as its diameter at the point where the spell is cast does not exceed 10 feet.</p>\n\n\t<p>The constriction takes 1 round to complete. Any Large or smaller object or creature that partially blocks the constrictions point is pushed, unharmed, to one side or the other.

A successful <em>dispel magic</em> or <em>knock</em> spell opens the constriction – the former by ending the spell and the latter by suppressing it for 10 minutes. If a creature burrows through the <em>earth lock</em>, the spell ends. The constricted tunnel can also be dug out normally.</p>\n\n\t<p>Identifying a tunnel secured with <em>earth lock</em> (as opposed to a tunnel that just ends) requires a DC 20 Search check.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Material component:</em> A diamond chip worth at least 50 gp, embedded in a piece of charcoal.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Because magic is so powerful, so too is the ability to dispel magic.  You can use <em>dispel magic</em> to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. <em>Dispel magic</em> can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.</p>\n\n\t<p>Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect  is already over before the <em>dispel magic</em> can take effect. Thus, you can't use <em>dispel magic</em> to repair damage caused by a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/\"><em>fireball</em></a> or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake.</p>\n\n\t<p>You choose to use <em>dispel magic</em> in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Targeted Dispel:</em> One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.</p>\n\n\t<p>For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets <em>dispel magic</em> on a drow who is under the effects of <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/haste--2823/\"><em>haste</em></a>, <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/mage-armor--2405/\"><em>mage armor</em></a>, and <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/bulls-strength--2788/\"><em>bull's strength</em></a>. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the <em>haste</em>, <em>mage armor</em>, and <em>bull's strength</em> effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect.</p>\n\n\t<p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</p>\n\n\t<p>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</p>\n\n\t<p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Area Dispel:</em> When <em>dispel magic</em> is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.</p>\n\n\t<p>For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.</p>\n\n\t<p>For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.</p>\n\n\t<p>For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the <em>dispel magic</em> spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.</p>\n\n\t<p>For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the <em>dispel magic</em> spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.</p>\n\n\t<p>If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.</p>\n\n\t<p>You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Counterspell:</em> When <em>dispel magic</em> is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, <em>dispel magic</em> may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>You hold the eye in your palm, sprinkle it with blood and diamonds, and speak the words. Slowly it rises from your hand, emitting a soft beam that illuminates the chosen area. Then it disappears, and you place the spell within the magic trap.</em></p>\n\n\t<p>You create a lingering zone of transformative magic that absorbs magic energy from magic items or spellcasting and uses it to power another spell tied to that location. For example, you could have an <em>energy transformation field</em> tied to a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/summon-monster-v--2445/\"><em>summon monster V</em></a> spell that would summon a monster when the field had absorbed enough magic.</p>\n\n\t<p>The field absorbs the magic of spells cast, spell-like or supernatural abilities that are activated, and magic items used within its dimensions. Each source of magic provides spell levels of energy to the field equal to the spell level of the effect used. Supernatural abilities that emulate spells provide energy equal to the spell level of the effect. Super-natural abilities that do not emulate spells provide energy equal to the HD of the creature using the ability. For example, a cast <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/\"><em>fireball</em></a> spell or a charge from a <em>wand of fireball</em> would add three spell levels to the field's store, a <em>potion of cure light wounds</em> would add one, and a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/wish--2902/\"><em>wish</em></a> from a <em>ring of three wishes</em> would add nine. Items that don't have a clearly defined spell level (such as the effects of most rods) use the prerequisite caster level needed to create that item (so an <em>immovable rod</em> would provide two spell levels every time it was activated because of its <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/levitate--2830/\"><em>levitate</em></a> prerequisite). Effects that are absorbed give no indication of where the magic went; they simply vanish.</p>\n\n\t<p>The field absorbs only magic that is actually used within its area. Ongoing magical effects that enter the area, including spells cast from outside the area into the field or continually functioning items such as a +1 mace, are often visibly reduced, but do not have their actual effects hindered. For example, a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/continual-flame--2598/\"><em>continual flame</em></a> would dim slightly, but its overall magic would not be affected.</p>\n\n\t<p>An <em>energy transformation field</em> has a single spell linked to it. When the field has absorbed spell levels equal to the spell level of its linked spell, it automatically casts that spell at a point within the field designated by you at the time of the casting of the field. This expends those absorbed spell levels (although unused levels remain until they are used or expire). The cast spell functions as if cast by you in terms of duration and all level-based spell effects. Absorbed spell levels fade at a rate of one per day if not used. The field automatically triggers its linked spell if it has enough stored spell levels and the duration of its previous casting has expired. If a linked spell requires concentration to maintain, the field expends one spell level for every hour of concentration (the field's concentration is interrupted only by its complete destruction). Spells that require a target will target the living creature nearest to the field.</p>\n\n\t<p>Typical spells linked to an energy transformation field are \"<em>blindness/deafness</em>\":spells/players-handbook-v35—6/blindnessdeafness—2715/, <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/\"><em>fireball</em></a>, <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/suggestion--2573/\"><em>suggestion</em></a>, <em>summon monster</em>, or <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/wall-of-force--2659/\"><em>wall of force</em></a>.

If a window is within range, the subject is automatically thrown in that direction.</p>\n\n\t<p>If some obstacle prevents the subject creature from reaching its expelled height, it takes 1d6 for every 10 feet of movement it was unable to complete, so that a creature hurled 50 feet up in a room with a 20-foot ceiling would take 3d6 points of damage from the impact, then take 2d6 points of damage when it falls back to the ground.</p>\n\n\t<p>The sphere can affect a maximum of one creature or object per round, and winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Focus:</em> a gray pearlo worth at least 100 gp.</p>",

Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.</p>\n\n\t<p>You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the <em>fireball</em> at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation). If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must \"hit\" the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.</p>\n\n\t<p>The <em>fireball</em> sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.</p>\n\n\t<p>Material Component: A tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur.</p>",

Magic items you possess work normally with respect to their effects on you or on another target.</p>\n\n\t<p>As an incorporeal creature, you have no natural armor bonus but have a deflection bonus equal to your Charisma bonus (always at least +1, even if your Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus). </p>\n\n\t<p>You can enter or pass through solid objects while in <em>ghostform</em>, but you must remain adjacent to the object's exterior, and so you cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than your own. You can sense the presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to your current location, but enemies have total concealment from you while you are inside an object. In order to see farther from the object you are in and attack normally, you must emerge. While inside an object, you have total cover, but when you attack a creature outside the object you have cover only, so a creature outside with a readied action could strike at you as you attack. You cannot pass through a force effect. </p>\n\n\t<p>You can pass through and operate in water as easily as you do in air. You cannot fall or take falling damage. You cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can you be tripped or grappled. In fact, you cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor are you subject to such actions. You have no weight while in <em>ghostform</em> and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight.</p>\n\n\t<p>You move silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if you don't wish to be while in <em>ghostform</em>. You have no Strength score while incorporeal, so your Dexterity modifier applies to both your melee attacks and ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to you. You have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when you cannot see.</p>",

The whispers begin to build upon one another, echoing in the air around you, swirling and twisting until they become a steady cacophony. The wind gathers speed, creating a spherical vortex around you.</em></p>\n\n\t<p>With this spell, you create a swirling miniature storm that provides a measure of protection, but leaves you and those near you unaffected.</p>\n\n\t<p>The storm that surrounds you has hurricane-force winds spinning in a circle with you at the center. Normal ranged attacks through the hurricane's windy area are impossible, and even heavier projectiles such as siege weapons and giant boulders take a -8 penalty on the attack roll.</p>\n\n\t<p>Creatures who move inside the spell's area suffer effects depending on their size and whether theyÂ¿re airborne. Each creature must make a saving throw at the beginning of its turn or when in enters the affected area.</p>\n\n\t<p>Medium or smaller creatures mus succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked 1d4×10 feet away from the eye of the hurricane's center and take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per10 feet traveled in this manner. Creatures blown away are knocked prone as well. Flying creatures are blown back 2d6×10 feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage.</p>\n\n\t<p>Large creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone by the force of the wind. Flying creatures are instead blown back 1d6×10 feet.</p>\n\n\t<p>Huge creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be checked. Flying creatures are instead blown back 1d6×5 feet.</p>\n\n\t<p>Gargantuan and Colossal creatures can move through the spell's area without adverse consequences.</p>\n\n\t<p>Even creatures that succeed on their saving throws must attempt them again whenever they start a turn inside the spell's area or whenever they move back into it.</p>\n\n\t<p>The spell's area is effectively a sphere. Although the area is centered on you, you're not within the wind. if you move, the eye of the hurricane moves as well to keep you in the center. If you cast <em>eye of the hurricane</em> so that creatures are inside the eye when the spell begins, they must make Fortitude saves when your movement brings the area of wind upon them. Thereafter, if you move the spell area into a square occupied by another creature, that creature makes a Fortitude save at the beginning of its next turn (assuming the windy area of the spell is still on it).</p>",

    "description": "<p>Casting a <em>gate</em> spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.</p>\n\n\t<p>Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the <em>gate</em>. The <em>gate</em> itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.</p>\n\n\t<p>A <em>gate</em> has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the <em>gate</em> from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Planar Travel:</em> As a mode of planar travel, a <em>gate</em> spell functions much like a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/plane-shift--2423/\"><em>plane shift</em></a> spell, except that the <em>gate</em> opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a <em>gate</em> from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you—anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A <em>gate</em> cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.</p>\n\n\t<p>You could position a <em>gate</em> in a hallway in order to absorb any attack or force coming at you by shunting it to another plane. Whether the denizens of that plane appreciate this tactic is, of course, another matter.</p>\n\n\t<p>You may hold the <em>gate</em> open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Calling Creatures:</em> The second effect of the <em>gate</em> spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the <em>gate</em> to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the <em>gate</em>, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a <em>gate</em> that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).</p>\n\n\t<p>If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual—for instance, a bearded devil or a ghaele eladrin—you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.</p>\n\n\t<p>A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature's help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.</p>\n\n\t<p>If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards.

In either case, you can imbue one spell per three caster levels, with a maximum spell level of one-third your caster level, rounded down (maximum 5th level). Multiple castings of imbue familiar with spell ability have no effect on these limits.<br>The transferred spell's variable characteristics (range, duration, area, and so on) function according to your level. Once you cast imbue familiar with spell ability on your familiar, both the spell slot from which you cast the spell and the spell slots of the transferred spells remain unavailable for the preparation or casting of new spells  until  the  familiar  uses  the transferred spells or imbue familiar with spell ability expires.<br>The spell can be dispelled; if this happens,  the  spells  transferred  are lost as if the familiar had cast them. In an antimagic field, the familiar loses the ability to cast the imbued spells, but regains it again if it leaves the field (as long as the spell's duration hasn't expired).<br>If any transferred spell requires a focus or material component, you must have it on your person when the spells are cast (components are consumed as normal without requiring you to bring them to hand). Any XP costs from a transferred spell are deducted from your total when the familiar casts the spell.</p>",

The effect is a railless ribbon of glowing white translucent force like a glass strip. The strip can be from 3 to 20 feet wide as you decide. (You can vary the width over the ribbon's length if you want.) It sticks to its endpoints unshakably, even if these endpoints are in midair.</p>\n\n\t<p>At the time of casting, you designate up to one creature per caster level to receive extra protection while standing on or moving along the moon path. Protected creatures gain the benefit of a sanctuary effect. This functions like the 1st-level spell <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/sanctuary--2359/\"><em>sanctuary</em></a> except that the save DC is 15 + your Wis modifier, and any subject of the spell who attacks breaks the sanctuary effect for all subjects. Protected creatures also stick to the top of the moon path as though they have received spider climb spells. A creature loses both benefits immediately when it leaves the path.</p>\n\n\t<p>Unlike a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/wall-of-force--2659/\"><em>wall of force</em></a>, a moon path can be dispelled. It is otherwise similar to a wall of force in that it needs no supports and it is immune to damage of all kinds. A disintegrate spell blasts a hole in the path 10 feet square, leaving the rest of the path intact. (If the moon path is 10 feet wide or less, this merely creates a 10-foot gap.) A hit from a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, or Mordenkainen's disjunction destroys a moon path. Spells and breath weapons cannot pass through a moon path, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material creatures. Gaze attacks cannot operate through a moon path. </p>\n\n\t<p>A moon path must be straight, continuous, and unbroken when formed. If its surface would be interrupted by any object or creature, the spell fails. The bridge version of the spell must be created flat. The stair version cannot rise or descend any more sharply than 45 degrees.</p>\n\n\t<p>Arcane Material Component: A white handkerchief.</p>",

You speak the words and feel the power of the plane buckle within your mind, then relax as you impress order upon the chaos.</em></p>\n\n\t<p>This spell grants temporary control over the terrain of Limbo. Normally, unless controlled, the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo (<span class=\"caps\">DMG</span> 158) is just what the plane's name implies: a roiling soup of energy and elements. Natives learn to control it or to inhabit areas that have enjoyed some measure of control for a long period, but visitors to areas of \"raw\" limbo must make a DC 16 Wisdom check to gain control over the dangerous roil.</p>\n\n\t<p>The perinarch spell gives you automatic control of a radius of raw Limbo (an area not already stabilized or within some other creature's control) in close range. Control allows you to reshape the raw limbo as you desire, adding or subtracting one of the four basic elements once per round as a standard action. A favorite among travelers from the Material Plane is a chunk of earth surrounded by a small atmosphere of air.</p>\n\n\t<p>The effect of this spell overlaps with the control already (potentially) established with a Wisdom check. Your allies can give their control over to you concurrently with the spell being cast, if they so choose. Control cannot be wrested away from you while the spell is in effect (which is one of the best reasons to cast this spell, even if you have a high Wisdom). If you move more than 100 feet away from the area that you controlled, the order you imposed fades away.</p>\n\n\t<p>You are unable to achieve any works of complexity within an area you control, but you can mix two or three elements in a crude fashion; a few examples are provided below. You can attempt to seize control of a new area that already contains foes; however, foes can make a Reflex save to get out of the area.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Thick Barrier:</strong> You can \"thicken\" empty air with dust and rock, creating a zone around yourself and your allies that outside creatures must hack or force a way through. Their speed drops to 5 feet, or 10 feet for Large or larger creatures.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Fiery Barrier:</strong> You can create a thick field of flame that deals 3d10 points of fire damage to any creature attempting to pass through it. The field also deals 3d10 points of fire damage for each round a creature lingers within it.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Complete Barrier:</strong> You can create a complete barrier of solid stone up to 1 foot thick encircling yourself and your allies, preventing access by any other than the most accomplished tunnelers. On the other hand, you can attempt to trap foes within their own bubble of solid stone.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.</p>\n\n\t<p>Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.</p>\n\n\t<p>Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions). Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. See Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat.</p>\n\n\t<p>Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell.</p>\n\n\t<p>Arcane Material Component: An eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This spell functions like lesser infernal transformation, except when you cast this spell, you assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a bone devil (MM 52). While under the effect of the spell, your creature type changes to outsider (baatezu, evil, lawful), and your size changes to Large. You have the space and reach of a bone devil (10 feet/10 feet). You gain a +4 profane bonus to Strength and Constitution and darkvision out to 60 feet. You gain damage reduction 5/good.<br>You also grow a tail like that of a scorpion. Whenever you take a full attack action, you can use the tail to make an additional attack each round at your highest attack bonus. A successful attack deals 3d4 points of damage + your Str modifier. This attack overcomes damage reduction as if it were an evil weapon. Creatures hit by the tail attack must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 character level + Con modifier) or be subjected to poison (injury, initial damage 1d6 Str, secondary damage 2d6 Str). Your equipment grows to match your new size and form, allowing the tail attack to function even if you are wearing heavy armor or other restrictive clothing. You gain the ability to speak and understand Infernal.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.</p>\n\n\t<p>First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.</p>\n\n\t<p>Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as dominate person). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.</p>\n\n\t<p>Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Arcane Material Component:</em> A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-foot -diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.</p>",

    "description": "<p>You create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs (called \"eyes\") equal to 1d4 + your caster level. These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.</p>\n\n\t<p>While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and has a +16 Hide modifier. It has a Spot modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch.</p>\n\n\t<p>When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well, so if you know, for example, what a typical merchant looks like, the eyes do as well.</p>\n\n\t<p>A sample command: \"Surround me at a range of four hundred feet and return if you spot any dangerous creatures\". The phrase \"Surround me\" directs the eyes to form an equally spaced, horizontal ring at whatever range you indicate, and then move with you. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. In the case of this sample command, an eye returns only if it spots a creature you would regard as dangerous. A \"peasant\" that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn't trigger an eye's return. Ten eyes can form a ring with a radius of 400 feet and between themselves see everything that crosses the ring.</p>\n\n\t<p>Another sample command: \"Spread out and search the town for Arweth. Follow him for three minutes, staying out of sight, and then return\". The phrase \"Spread out\" directs the eyes to move away from you in all directions. In this case, each eye would separately follow Arweth for three minutes once it spots him.</p>\n\n\t<p>Other commands that might be useful include having eyes form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or having them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of your directions.</p>\n\n\t<p>In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears.</p>\n\n\t<p>If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won't know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.</p>\n\n\t<p>The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/dispel-magic--2315/\"><em>Dispel magic</em></a> can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel. Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself.</p>\n\n\t<p>Material Component: A handful of crystal marbles.</p>",

When casting a targeted dispel or counterspell, you can choose to reave each spell you successfully dispel, stealing its power and effect for yourself. When making a targeted dispel, make a Spellcraft check (DC 25 + spell level) to identify the target spell or each ongoing spell currently in effect on the target creature or object. </p>\n\n\t<p>Each spell you dispel with a targeted dispel can be reaved if you so desire, and the spell's effects are redirected to you, continuing as if cast on you by the original caster with no interruption to or extension of duration. Once you reave the spell, you identify it if you haven't done so already (see below). If the subject was the caster and the spell is dismissible, you can dismiss it as if you had cast it yourself. Likewise, if the subject was the caster and the spell requires concentration, you must concentrate to maintain the spell's effect as if you had cast it yourself.</p>\n\n\t<p>You can still attempt to reave a spell you didn't identify with your Spellcraft check, but doing so can be risky if you don't know the specifics of the spell's effect. For example, if you fail to identity an ongoing spell effect on an enemy character and choose to reave anyway, you might find yourself under the influence of the dominate person effect that character was suffering from. Any spell resistance you might have has no effect against harmful spells you might inadvertently reave, but you get the same chance to save against those spell effects as the original target.</p>\n\n\t<p>If you choose to reave a spell you have successfully counterspelled with reaving dispel, you seize control of the spell after the enemy caster completes it, and you can redirect the spell to whatever targets or area you wish (including the original caster, if appropriate). Again, you must make a Spellcraft check (DC 25 + spell level) to identify the spell you intend to reave, but you are free to choose to redirect a spell whose effect, range, and area you don't know. If the redirected spell's correct casting conditions aren't met (because you guess at an improper target or range, for example), the spell fails.</p>\n\n\t<p>Reaving dispel can be used to cast an area dispel with the increased maximum caster level, but any magical effects so dispelled cannot be reaved.</p>",

Casting the spell gives you access to all of the subject's thoughts and memories, allowing you to implement as many of the following specific effects as you like.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Memory Erasure:</strong> Memories possessed by the subject can be erased, including knowledge of specific events, people, or places. You can erase up to one full week of memories from the subject's mind.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Memory Implant:</strong> You can create false memories in the subject's mind as you see fit. You can implant memories of being friends with a hated enemy, events that didn't really take place, or betrayals by people the subject regards as friends.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Negative Levels:</strong> You can bestow a number of negative levels equal to 1/2 the subject's character level (rounding down, minimum 1st level) or less. This effect represents erasure of class knowledge and training. These negative levels never become permanent level loss, but they cannot be removed by spells such as restoration, instead returning at a rate of one level per day.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Persona Rebuilding:</strong> By erasing the subject's previous personality and implanting a false set of memories, you can build a new persona for the creature, altering its alignment, beliefs, values, and personality traits. (Some class abilities might be affected by alignment changes.)</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Programmed Trigger:</strong> You can program the subject to delay the onset of any of the above effects until a specific event takes place, such as the receipt of a coded message, capture by enemies, or arrival at some destination. Similarly, you could specify some or all of the alterations you create in a subject to be removed by a specific event.</p>\n\n\t<p>The nature of programmed amnesia is such that a subject given new memories (whether willing or not) might be given cause to suspect that those memories are false, based on how complete your programming is. For example, a paladin subject to a persona rebuilding effect that changes her alignment to neutral loses her paladin abilities. Unless you impart a specific believable memory of why she changed alignment, the character will perceive this unexplained gap in her memory and might take steps (such as seeking a magical cure for her \"amnesia\") that could negate the spell's effect (see below).</p>\n\n\t<p>Generally, your subject must be either willing to undergo the spell or restrained in some way so that it cannot leave or interfere with the casting. Programmed amnesia cannot be dispelled, and so is normally permanent unless you care to specify events that will end the effect. Its effect can also be removed by a greater restoration, miracle, or wish spell.</p>\n\n\t<p>Material Component: A set of small crystal lenses set in gold loops worth 500 gp.</p>",

If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you—the spell cannot crush you by increasing your size.</p>\n\n\t<p>All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons deal more damage (see Table 2-2 in the Dungeon Master's Guide). Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them). </p>\n\n\t<p>Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase your size while you are still under the effect of the first casting.</p>",

Any creature attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack anyone within the safe clearing, or any creature attempting to enter the area, must make a Will save. Success means the creature can act normally and is not affected by this casting of the spell. Failure means it can't attack anyone in the area or even enter the area for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack creatures in the warded area remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent creatures in the warded area from being attacked or affected by area spells.</p>\n\n\t<p>A creature within the area that makes an attack is no longer protected by the spell, and can be targeted normally.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back upon the original caster. The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. Spell turning also fails to stop touch range spells. Thus, a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/charm-person--2535/\"><em>charm person</em></a> spell cast at you could be turned back upon the caster and possibly enable you to use the charm effect on that individual, but a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/\"><em>fireball</em></a> could not be turned back, and neither could inflict critical wounds.</p>\n\n\t<p>From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The DM secretly rolls the exact number. When a spell is turned, the DM subtracts its level from the amount of spell turning left. </p>\n\n\t<p>When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turning you have left, that spell is partially turned. The subtract the amount of spell turning left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be affected. </p>\n\n\t<p>For example, if you had three levels of spell turning left and were targeted by a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/magic-missile--2631/\"><em>magic missile</em></a> spell heightened to 4th level, you  would turn three-fourths of the spell back at the caster. You would take one-forth of the damage, while the caster takes three-fourths of the damage. If you were targeted by a wizard's <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fear--2736/\"><em>fear</em></a> spell (also a 4th-level spell) in the same situation, you would have a one in four (25%) chance to be affected by the spell, while the caster would have a three in four (75%) chance to be affected.</p>\n\n\t<p>If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by <em>spell turning</em> effects in operation, a resonating field is created.</p>\n\n\t<p>Roll randomly to determine the result.</p>\n\n\t<table>\n\t\t<tbody><tr>\n\t\t\t<th>d% </th>\n\t\t\t<th>Effect </th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 01-70 </td>\n\t\t\t<td> Spell drains away without effect. </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 71-80 </td>\n\t\t\t<td> Spell affects both of you equally at full effect. </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 81-97 </td>\n\t\t\t<td> Both turning effects are rendered nonfunctional for 1d4 minutes. </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 98-100 </td>\n\t\t\t<td> Both of you go through a rift into another plane. </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody></table>\n\n\t<p>Arcane Material Component: A small silver mirror.</p>",

    "description": "<p>A weapon made of pure force springs into existence and attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a  flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats (such as Weapon Focus) or combat actions (such as charge) do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. </p>\n\n\t<p>Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.</p>\n\n\t<p>A spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A spiritual weapon's AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object). </p>\n\n\t<p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.</p>\n\n\t<p>The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon, many of which have individual names. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a spiritual weapon of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time.</p>\n\n\t<p>The weapons associated with each deity or alignment are as follows.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Boccob:</em> Quarterstaff, \"Staff of Boccob\"<br><em>Corellon Larethian:</em> Longsword, \"Sahandrian\"<br><em>Ehlonna:</em> Longsword, \"Jenevier\"<br><em>Erythnul:</em> Morningstar, \"Agony\"<br><em>Fharlanghn:</em> Quarterstaff, \"Traveler's Friend\"<br><em>Garl Glittergold:</em> Battleaxe, \"Arumdina\"<br><em>Gruumsh:</em> Spear, \"Bloodspear\"<br><em>Heironeous:</em> Longsword, \"Justice-bringer\"<br><em>Hextor:</em> Flail, \"Executioner\"<br><em>Kord:</em> Greatsword, \"Kelmar\"<br><em>Moradin:</em> Warhammer, \"Soulhammer\"<br><em>Nerull:</em> Scythe, \"Lifecutter\"<br><em>Obad-Hai:</em> Quarterstaff, \"Stormstouch\"<br><em>Olidammara:</em> Rapier, \"Swiftstrike\"<br><em>Pelor:</em> Heavy Mace, \"Sunscepter\"<br><em>St. Cuthbert:</em> Heavy Mace, \"The Mace of Cuthbert\"<br><em>Vecna:</em> Dagger, \"Afterthought\"<br><em>Wee Jas:</em> Dagger, \"Discretion\"<br><em>Yondalla:</em> Short sword, \"Hornblade\"<br><em>Chaos:</em> Battleaxe, \"The Blade of Change\"<br><em>Evil:</em> Light flail, \"The Scourge of Souls\"<br><em>Good:</em> Warhammer, \"The Hammer of Justice\"<br><em>Law:</em> Sword, \"The Sword of Truth\"</p>",

The average temperature increases by 30 degrees, or decreases by 30 degrees if the desert is actually a tundra (see Cold Dangers and Heat Dangers, <span class=\"caps\">DMG</span> 302—303). Sandstorms (or snowstorms if in a tundra) blow through a shadow landscape desert on an hourly basis.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Forest:</strong> Forests augmented with a shadow landscape spell become frightening places where a canopy of rotting leaves blocks the sun and all the trees are strangely twisted. Spaces with light undergrowth have heavy undergrowth instead, and spaces covered with heavy undergrowth grasp at passersby as if an <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/entangle--2807/\"><em>entangle</em></a> spell (PH 227) had been cast on them (save DC equal to the shadow landscape's DC).</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Hill:</strong> Even gentle hills become more treacherous under the effect of a shadow landscape spell. Light undergrowth becomes heavy undergrowth in hill terrain, and slopes seem steeper than their elevation would indicate. It takes 2 squares of movement to move uphill on a gradual slope, and 4 squares to move uphill on a steep slope. Cliffs have frequent overhangs and are made of crumbling rock, requiring a DC 25 Climb check to ascend or descend.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Marsh:</strong> Marshes seem swampier and more forbidding. Half the undergrowth spaces in the marsh become quicksand (<span class=\"caps\">DMG</span> 88).</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Mountain:</strong> The mountains become places of jagged peaks, slippery slopes, and howling winds. Cliffs and chasms require a DC 25 Climb check to scale. Creatures who fail Climb checks or make loud  noises have a 10% chance of starting an avalanche (<span class=\"caps\">DMG</span> 90). Altitude effects are one category worse: areas lower than 5,000 feet are treated as the 5,000- to 15,000-foot category, and anything above 5,000 feet is treated as being above 15,000 feet.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Plain:</strong> Only natural grasslands change as a result of shadow landscape, but they become wide-open spaces with stands of thick bushes where thunderstorms and tornados are frequent. Half the spaces with undergrowth (light or heavy) grasp at passersby as if an <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/entangle--2807/\"><em>entangle</em></a> spell (PH 227) had been cast on them (save DC equal to the shadow landscape's DC).</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Underground:</strong> Ordinary dungeons aren't affected by shadow landscape, but naturally occurring caverns are. Natural stone floors take 4 squares of movement per space to enter. Stalagmites cover 10% of the available floor space.</p>\n\n\t<p>In addition to terrain-specific effects, a shadow landscape spell worsens the weather within the spell's area. When rolling random weather (<span class=\"caps\">DMG</span> 94), roll twice and take the higher result. In plains terrain, roll three times and take the highest result. This effect does not apply underground.</p>\n\n\t<p>You don't suffer the terrain-specific effects (entangling terrain, hindrances to movement, altitude effects, higher Climb DCs, and so on) of a shadow landscape you created. When you cast shadow landscape, you can designate one creature per four caster levels as a designated traveler. Creatures so designated don't suffer the terrain-specific effects of the spell, but they're still subject to the bad weather.</p>\n\n\t<p>You can also designate one or more animals, plants, or magical beasts native to the spell's area as shadow guardians of the landscape. You can designate 1 HD of creature per caster level, split up however you like. For example, a 20th-level druid could designate two treants (7 HD each) and a dire wolf (6 HD) as shadow guardians. As long as the designated guardians remain within the spell's area, they have a friendly attitude toward you and the travelers you have designated, and they also gain the following special qualities: resistance to cold 10, darkvision out to 60 feet, damage reduction 5/magic, evasion, and lowlight vision. If the creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the better value.</p>",

The jaws attempt to grapple the designated opponent, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. The <em>spiritjaws</em> use your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) + your Wis modifier as it's attack bonus. If an initial attack hits, the <em>spirtjaws</em> deal 2d6 points of damage and attempt to start a grapple as a free action.  The jaws' bonus on grapple checks is equal to their attack bonus + 4.</p>\n\n\t<p>Once the opponent is grappled, the jaws deal 2d6 points of damage with each subsequent grapple check. The target is considered to be grappling and can not move. The target creature no longer threatens squares and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC against opponents not grappling it.</p>\n\n\t<p>The set of jaws always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. Your feats do not affect the jaws. If the jaws move beyond the range of the spell, they vanish. Attacking the set of jaws has no effect. As a magical force effect, the jaws cannot be damaged, but <em>disintegrate</em> or a <em>sphere of annihilation</em> destroys it's effect.</p>\n\n\t<p>The grappled opponent can cast a spell only if the spell has no somatic component, the material components are in band, and a Concentration check (DC20 + spell level) is made. A creature grappled by the set of jaws can attempt to escape by succeeding on a grapple check against the jaws or by making a successful Escape Artist check as a standard action opposed by the set of jaws' grapple check.</p>\n\n\t<p>As a free action, you can direct the jaws to pin a grappled opponent instead of dealing damage with a grapple check. If the jaws win the opposed grapple check, the opponent is pinned. A pinned opponent is held immobile and must break the pin before it can escape the grapple. Creatures other than those grappling the pinned target gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls to hit it. If the jaws have multiple attacks (granted by your attack bonus), you can use them to cause damage to a pinned target or to make more grapple attempts against that target.</p>\n\n\t<p>Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the <em>spiritjaws</em> to a new target. If you do not, the <em>spiritjaws</em> continue to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the <em>spiritjaws</em> switches targets, it gets one attack.

Such a creature is rooted in place and unable to move. It can take actions normally; it just can't move from the space it currently occupies.

Creatures that start their turn in the affected area must attempt another Reflex save or be affected by the spell.</p>\n\n\t<p>A held creature can attempt a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to break free, and can also break free by dealing enough damage to destroy the arm. An arm has AC 15, hardness 8, and 15 hit points.</p>\n\n\t<p>Before they attack, the arms remain beneath the surface of the stone.

Otherwise, you are merely stuck to the saddle, but the saddle is attached to the mount normally. If you are knocked unconscious while this spell is in effect, you automatically remain in the saddle. The spell can be dismissed as an immediate action, and it does not impede the rider from making a soft fall if the mount is dropped in battle.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>The eldest, most powerful forces of elemental water heed your summons and obey your request. These forces of pure elemental power gather together a wall of water that moves inexorably in the direction of your choice, crushing all that it encounters.</em></p>\n\n\t<p>This spell creates a towering tsunami and sends it forth in a powerful wave to smash all in its path. The tsunami starts at any point you select within range of the spell and then moves at a speed of 60 feet in any direction chosen by you. Once the direction is set, the tsunami cannot change course. The tsunami deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to all in its path. Anything struck can make a Fortitude saving throw for half damage. Gargantuan or larger creatures that fail the save are knocked prone. Huge or smaller creatures that fail the save are picked up and carried with the wave. Each round a victim is carried by the tsunami, it takes the bludgeoning damage again and can make an additional Fortitude save for half damage. Creatures being carried by a tsunami cannot move in any other way. They can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in a tsunami take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. They can escape the wave by making successful DC 20 Swim checks, as long as they end their movement outside the effect of the tsunami.</p>\n\n\t<p>Any creature that comes in contact with a tsunami as a result of movement during its turn is considered to have been struck by the tsunami's movement. A creature can attempt to extract another creature caught by a tsunami, providing the rescuer resists being swept up or knocked down by the tsunami and can reach the victim. Extracting a victim in this manner requires a DC 20 Strength check. </p>\n\n\t<p>A tsunami's progress can be halted by anything that would normally block line of effect along its path, assuming the tsunami does not destroy the intervening object or creature. If only a portion of the tsunami is blocked, the rest of it continues on.</p>\n\n\t<p>Although this spell can be cast on dry land, it is most effective when cast on the open sea. In this case, saving throws to avoid full damage are made with a -4 penalty, and the width of the tsunami increases to 40 feet per caster level. A tsunami that begins on water but then travels onto land immediately shrinks to its land size and speed. A tsunami does not vanish if it moves beyond the spell's initial range.</p>\n\n\t<p>Material Component: A crown of coral set with pearls (total value of at least 5,000 gp).</p>",

A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.</p>\n\n\t<p>This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.</p>\n\n\t<p>An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require  Intelligence checks against a DC set by the DM.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Combat Maneuver:</em> Alternatively, once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn't allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you  cease concentration.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Violent Thrust:</em> Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object  or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).</p>\n\n\t<p>You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects such as a barrel) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects such as a boulder).</p>\n\n\t<p>Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves  (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).</p>",

A sword of deception always strikes from your direction, and so it can't be used to flank with your attacks, but it could flank with your allies.</p>\n\n\t<p>The blade attacks with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level, dealing 1d8 points of damage per hit and threatening a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. In addition, each successful hit provides a -2 penalty on the target's next saving throw roll (-4 on a successful critical hit). This penalty is cumulative (to a maximum of -5 on a single creature) and lasts until the creature is forced to make a saving throw in a dangerous situation or receives the benefit of a remove curse spell.</p>\n\n\t<p>Each round, a sword of deception continues to attack the previous round's target unless you use a standard action to switch it to a new target within range. In any round when the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack as a standard action (as it does in the round when the spell is cast). The weapon can make multiple attack rolls against a single target with a full attack action if its base attack bonus permits. A sword of deception cannot be attacked or damaged (though it can be dispelled as any other spell).</p>\n\n\t<p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, make a caster level check the first time the sword attacks. If the check is successful, the sword can attack that creature with normal effect for the duration of the spell. If not, the sword of deception is dispelled.

A greater whirlwind affects creatures differently, depending on their size and where they are in relation to the twister.</p>\n\n\t<p>Near the Tornado: Large or smaller creatures who start their turn within 60 feet of the center of a greater whirlwind must succeed on a Fortitude save or be dragged 1d4Ã—10 feet toward the center of the twister, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet dragged.</p>\n\n\t<p>Huge creatures within 40 feet of the twister must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone. Gargantuan and Colossal creatures within 40 feet of the twister must succeed on a Fortitude save before moving away from the twister.</p>\n\n\t<p>Flying creatures of Huge size or smaller that fail their Fortitude saves are sucked to the center of the twister, taking 2d6 points of damage from the battering and buffeting. Gargantuan flying creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be pulled 1d6Ã—10 feet toward the center of the twister. Colossal flyers must likewise make Fortitude saves or be pulled 1d6Ã—5 feet toward the twister's center.</p>\n\n\t<p>Any Huge or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Large or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds. Any creature picked up is ejected 3 rounds later.</p>\n\n\t<p>Inside the Tornado: Creatures that start their turn inside the tornado take 6d6 points of damage for each round they remain inside at the beginning of your turn. Creatures inside the tornado can't do much; attacks, spellcasting, and movement are impossible within a greater whirlwind. When the greater whirlwind ejects a creature, it reappears 4d6Ã—5 feet away from the twister's center in a random direction, and 4d6Ã—5 feet off the ground (immediately falling if it can't fly).</p>\n\n\t<p>Terrain and Structures: The tornado uproots trees and other vegetation automatically, and it leaves a trail of dense rubble (<span class=\"caps\">DMG</span> 90) wherever it goes. Structures within a greater whirlwind take 2d6Ã—10 points of damage per round. In a round or two, that amount of damage is sufficient to destroy any building made of materials less sturdy than reinforced masonry.</p>\n\n\t<p>No ranged attacks can pass through the twister. A greater whirlwind extinguishes all flames it touches. Listen checks are impossible within a greater whirlwind.</p>\n\n\t<p>A greater whirlwind remains stationary unless you direct it elsewhere as a move action. It moves up to 60 feet per round.</p>",

Any attack against a wooden object discharges the spell, and wooden magic items are immune to the effect of wood rot.</p>\n\n\t<p>Against plant creatures, wood rot deals 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15) on a successful attack. Against plant creatures, the spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round. Once it is used to make an attack against a plant creature, wood rot cannot be used to attack or destroy wooden items.</p>\n\n\t<p>Material Component: A live termite.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Wish</em> is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even <em>wish</em>, however, has its limits.</p>\n\n\t<p>A <em>wish</em> can produce any one of the following effects.</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</li>\n\t\t<li>Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</li>\n\t\t<li>Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.</li>\n\t\t<li>Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.</li>\n\t\t<li>Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as <em>geas/quest</em> or <em>insanity</em>.</li>\n\t\t<li>Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value.</li>\n\t\t<li>Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item.</li>\n\t\t<li>Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five <em>wish</em> spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.</li>\n\t\t<li>Remove injuries and afflictions. A single <em>wish</em> can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same <em>wish</em>. A <em>wish</em> can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.</li>\n\t\t<li>Revive the dead. A <em>wish</em> can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A <em>wish</em> can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two <em>wish</em>, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A <em>wish</em> cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level.</li>\n\t\t<li>Transport travelers. A <em>wish</em> can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.</li>\n\t\t<li>Undo misfortune. A <em>wish</em> can undo a single recent event. The <em>wish</em> forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <em>wish</em> could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<p>You may try to use a <em>wish</em> to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. Such a <em>wish</em> gives the DM the opportunity to fulfil your request without fulfilling it completely. (The <em>wish</em> may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment). For example, wishing for a <em>staff of the</em> magi might get you instantly transported to the presence of the staff's current owner. Wishing to be immortal could get you imprisoned in a hidden extradimensional space (as by an imprisonment spell), where you could \"live\" indefinitely.</p>\n\n\t<p>Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Material Component:</em> When a <em>wish</em> duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>XP Cost:</em> The minimum XP cost for casting <em>wish</em> is 5,000 XP. When a <em>wish</em> duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a <em>wish</em> creates or improves a magic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP.</p>",
