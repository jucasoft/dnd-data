Whether she is there to steal gold, information, jewels, or secrets, an in?ltrator of the Nightsong Guild (see page 177) is trained to do her job quickly and ef?ciently. She practices extensively with locks and traps, focusing on doing her job under pressure and in unfavorable conditions. For example, nightsong in?ltrators train extensively in climbing, since they often have to scale walls and reach high windows. They have little time to work on combat training and relegate such concerns to their companions, the nightsong enforcers (see page 60).\n\nRogues most frequently and most easily become nightsong in?ltrators. Bards, urban rangers, and intelligent ?ghters can make good members of the class as well. Rarer, but possible, are spellcasting nightsong in?ltrators who use spells to get in and out of places. Woe to those wishing to protect their valuables from a Nightsong Guild member who can become invisible, walk through walls, or teleport.\n\nMembers of the Nightsong Guild rarely work alone. Usually they operate in teams, often in pairings of a nightsong in?ltrator and a nightsong enforcer. (For a PC nightsong in?ltrator, the other team member can be an adventuring ally.)

Because their devotion to one ideal is so great, an incarnate can only pick one extreme alignment component (good, evil, law, or chaos) and must be neutral in regards to the other alignment component.

As an illumine soul practices this unique talent, he learns to fill up his being with the power of the Positive Energy Plane, becoming a light in the darkness and turning undead away from his radiance. </p>\n\n\t<p>Desirous of something more than raw psychic energy, an illumine soul learns to reach behind the sky and form a mental link with the Positive Energy Plane. He entwines this energy with that of his own psionic mastery to create a formidable weapon of brilliance that extinguishes all shadows.</p>\n\n\t<p>Whether multiclass or single-classed, illumine souls must have some levels in the soulknife class, since it is that class from which they gain some of their necessary requirements. However, while soulknives focus on working with pure psychic energy, illumine souls infuse their mind blade (and mind and body as well) with positive energy. While not necessarily interested in or beholden to divine agencies, illumine souls focus a portion of their studies on religious matters to better understand the source of powerdrawn upon by clerics and paladins.</p>",
