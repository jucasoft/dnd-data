Make your Ride check at the start of your turn. If you fail, you can use only one hand this round because you need to use the other to control your mount. \n\n_Stay in Saddle:_ You can react instantly to try to avoid falling when your mount rears or bolts unexpectedly or when you take damage. This usage does not take an action. \n\n_Fight with Warhorse:_ If you direct your war-trained mount to attack in battle, you can still make your own attack or attacks normally. This usage is a free action. \n\n\n_Cover:_ You can react instantly to drop down and hang alongside your mount, using it as cover. You can't attack or cast spells while using your mount as cover. If you fail your Ride check, you don't et the cover benefit. This usage does not take an action. \n\n_Soft Fall:_ You can react instantly to try to take no damage when you fall off a mount--when it is killed or when it falls, for example. If you fail your Ride check, you take 1d6 points of falling damage. This usage does not take an action. \n\n_Leap:_  You can get your mount to leap obstacles as part of its movement. Use your Ride modifier or the mount's Jump modifier, whichever is lower, to see how far the creature can jump. If you fail your Ride check, you fall off the mount when it leaps and take the appropriate falling damage (at least 1d6 points). This usage does not take an action, but is part of the mount's movement. \n\n_Spur Mount:_  You can spur your mount to greater speed with a move action. A successful Ride check increases the mount's speed by 10 feet for 1 round but deals 1 point of damage to the creature. You can use this ability every round, but each consecutive round of additional speed deals twice as much damage to the mount as the previous round (2 points, 4 points, 8 points, and so on). \n\n_Control Mount in Battle:_ As a move action, you can attempt to control a light horse, pony, heavy horse, or other mount not trained for combat riding while in battle. If you fail the Ride check, you can do nothing else in that round. You do not need to roll for warhorses or warponies. \n\n_Fast Mount or Dismount:_ You can attempt to mount or dismount from a mount of up to one size category larger than yourself as a free action, provided that you still have a move action available that round. If you fail the Ride check, mounting or dismounting is a move action. You can't use fast mount or dismount on a mount more than one size category larger than yourself. ",

For instance, to command a trained attack dog to attack a foe requires a DC 10 Handle Animal check. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC  increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action. \n\n_�Push� an Animal:_ To push an animal means to get it to perform a task or trick that it doesn�t know but is physically capable of performing. This category also covers making an animal perform a forced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep cycles (see Chapter 9: Adventuring).  If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage,  the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.\n\n_Teach an Animal a Trick:_ You can teach an animal a specific trick with one week of work and a  successful Handle Animal check against the indicated DC. An animal with an Intelligence score of 1 (such as a snake or a shark) can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an  Intelligence score of 2 (such as a dog or a horse) can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible tricks  (and their associated DCs) include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following.\n\nAttack (DC 20): The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids, monstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to attack all creatures (including  such unnatural creatures as undead and aberrations) counts as two tricks.\n\nCome (DC 15): The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so (following you onto a  boat, for example).\n\nDefend (DC 20): The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even  without any command being given. Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other character.\n\nDown (DC 15): The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn�t know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.\n\nFetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the  animal fetches some random object.\n\nGuard (DC 20): The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching. \n\nHeel (DC 15): The animal follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn�t go.\n\nPerform (DC 15): The animal performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.\n\nSeek (DC 15): The animal moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.\n\nStay (DC 15): The animal stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other  creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.\n\nTrack (DC 20): The animal tracks the scent presented to it. (This requires the animal to have the  scent ability; see the Monster Manual for details.)\n\nWork (DC 15): The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load.\n\n_Train an Animal for a Purpose:_ Rather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can simply  train it for a general purpose. Essentially, an animal�s purpose represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all tricks included in the training package. If the package includes more than  three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2. An animal can be trained for only one  general purpose, though if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond  those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training an animal for a purpose requires fewer  checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no less time. At your DM�s option, you may be able to train an animal for a purpose that isn�t mentioned here.\n\nCombat Riding (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into combat knows the tricks attack, come,  defend, down, guard, and heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes six weeks. You may also �upgrade� an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat riding by spending three weeks and  making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. The new general purpose and tricks completely  replace the animal�s previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Warhorses and riding dogs (see the Monster Manual) are already trained to bear riders into combat, and they don�t require any additional training for this purpose.\n\nFighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows the tricks attack, down, and stay.  \nTraining an animal for fighting takes three weeks.\n\nGuarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the tricks attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes four weeks.\n\nHeavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes two weeks.\n\nHunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and  track. Training an animal for hunting takes six weeks.\n\nPerformance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance knows the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform,  and stay. Training an animal for performance takes five weeks.\n\nRiding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows the tricks come, heel, and stay. Training an  animal for riding takes three weeks.\n\n_Rear a Wild Animal:_ To rear an animal means to raise a wild creature from infancy so that it  becomes domesticated. A handler can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once. A successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time it�s being raised, or it can be  taught as a domesticated animal later.",

You know we lammasu are trustworthy, so you can believe me.\"_|\n\nFavorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff is hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes against its selfinterest, nature, personality, orders, or the like. If it's important, the DM can distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target doesn't believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on its Sense Motive check because the bluff demands something risky, and the Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn't so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff (and would have done so even if that bluff had not entailed any demand).\n\nA successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or believes something that you want it to believe. Bluff, however, is not a suggestion spell. For example, you could use bluff to put a shopkeeper off guard by saying that his shoes are untied. At best, such a bluff would make the shopkeeper glance down at his shoes. It would not cause him to ignore you and fiddle with his shoes.\n\nA bluff requires interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed.\n\nFeinting in Combat: You can also use Bluff to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so that it can't dodge your next attack effectively). To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by your target's Sense Motive check, but in this case, the target may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other applicable modifiers. If your Bluff check result exceeds this special Sense Motive check result, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This attack must be made on or before your next turn. Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because it's harder to read a strange creature's body language; you take a --4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2) it's even harder; you take a --8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it's impossible. Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity.\n\nCreating a Diversion to Hide: You can use the Bluff skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you. This usage does not provoke an attack of opportunity.\n\nDelivering a Secret Message: You can use Bluff to get a message across to another character without others understanding it. Two rogues, for example, might seem to be talking about bakery goods when they're really planning how to break into the evil wizard's laboratory. The DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure by 4 or less means you can't get the message across. Failure by 5 or more means that some false information has been implied or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can make a Sense Motive check opposed by the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your message (see Sense Motive, page 81).\n\n",

While climbing, you can�t move to avoid a blow, so you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). You also can�t use a shield while climbing.\n\nAny time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage. (The Dungeon Master�s Guide has information on falling damage.) \n\n*Accelerated Climbing:* You try to climb more quickly than normal. By accepting a �5 penalty, you can move half your speed (instead of one-quarter your speed).\n\n*Making Your Own Handholds and Footholds:* You can make your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with a handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an ice wall.\n\n*Catching Yourself When Falling:* It�s practically impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb check (DC = wall�s DC + 20) to do so. It�s much easier to catch yourself on a slope (DC = slope�s DC + 10).\n\n*Catching a Falling Character While Climbing:* If someone climbing above you or adjacent to you  falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing so requires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character (though he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall�s DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character�s fall but don�t lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop the character�s fall and begin falling as well.",
    "checkHtml": "\t<p>With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed.

    "check": "The DC and the distance you can cover vary according to the type of jump you are attempting (see below).\n\nYour Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30 feet (the speed of an unarmored human), then no modifier based on speed applies to the check. If your speed is less than 30 feet, you take a --6 penalty for every 10 feet of speed less than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet. For instance, if you have a speed of 20 feet, you take a --6 penalty on your Jump checks. If, on the other hand, your speed is 50 feet, you gain a +8 bonus.\n\nAll Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the jump is doubled.\n\nDistance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum movement in a round. For example, Krusk has a speed of 40 feet. If he moves 30 feet, then jumps across a 10-foot-wide chasm, he's then moved 40 feet total, so that's his move action.\n\nIf you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you land on your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check untrained, you land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.\n\n_Long Jump:_ A long jump is a horizontal jump, made across a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet). For example, a 10-foot-wide pit requires a DC 10 Jump check to cross.\n\nIf your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you fail the check by less than 5, you don't clear the distance, but you can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your movement grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm or gap, getting up requires a move action and a DC 15 Climb check.\n\n\n|_. Long Jump Distance |_. Jump DC ^1^ |_.\t\n| 5 feet | 5 |\n| 10 feet | 10 |\n| 15 feet | 15 |\n| 20 feet | 20 |\n| 25 feet | 25 |\n| 30 feet | 30 |\n\n^1^ Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC.\n\n_High Jump:_ A high jump is a vertical leap made to reach a ledge high above or to grasp something overhead, such as a tree limb. The DC is equal to 4 times the distance to be cleared. For example, the DC for a high jump to land atop a 3-foot-high ledge is 12 (3 � 4). \n\nIf you jumped up to grab something, a successful check indicates that you reached the desired height. If you wish to pull yourself up, you can do so with a move action and a DC 15 Climb check. If you fail the Jump check, you do not reach the height, and you land on your feet in the same spot from which you jumped. As with a long jump, the DC is doubled if you do not get a running start of at least 20 feet.\n\n|_. High Jump Distance ^1^ |_. Jump DC ^2^ |_.\t\n| 1 foot | 4 |\n| 2 feet | 8 |\n| 3 feet | 12 |\n| 4 feet | 16 |\n| 5 feet | 20 |\n| 6 feet | 24 |\n| 7 feet | 28 |\n| 8 feet | 32 |\n\n^1^ Not including vertical reach; see below.\n^2^ Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC.\n\nObviously, the difficulty of reaching a given height varies according to the size of the character or creature. The maximum vertical reach (height the creature can reach without jumping) for an average creature of a given size is shown on the table below. (As a Medium creature, a typical human can reach 8 feet without jumping.) Quadrupedal creatures (such as horse) don't have the same vertical reach as a bipedal creature; treat them as being one size category smaller. \n\n|_. Creature Size |_. Vertical Reach |_.\t\n| Colossal | 128 ft. |\n| Gargantuan | 64 ft. |\n| Huge | 32 ft. |\n| Large | 16 ft. |\n| Medium | 8 ft. |\n| Small | 4 ft. |\n| Tiny | 2 ft. |\n| Diminutive | 1 ft. |\n| Fine | 1/2 ft. |\n\n_Hop Up:_ You can jump up onto an object as tall as your waist, such as a table or small boulder, with a DC 10 Jump check. Doing so counts as 10 feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet, then hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.\n\n_Jumping Down:_ If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if you just fell. The DC to jump down from a height is 15. You do not have to get a running start to jump down, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.\n\nIf you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did. Thus, if you jump down from a height of just 10 feet, you take no damage. If you jump down from a height of 20 feet, you take damage as if you had fallen 10 feet.\n",

If, on the other hand, your speed is 50 feet, you gain a +8 bonus.</p>\n\n\t<p>All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the jump is doubled.</p>\n\n\t<p>Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum movement in a round. For example, Krusk has a speed of 40 feet. If he moves 30 feet, then jumps across a 10-foot-wide chasm, he&#39;s then moved 40 feet total, so that&#39;s his move action.</p>\n\n\t<p>If you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you land on your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check untrained, you land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Long Jump:</em> A long jump is a horizontal jump, made across a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet). For example, a 10-foot-wide pit requires a DC 10 Jump check to cross.</p>\n\n\t<p>If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you fail the check by less than 5, you don&#39;t clear the distance, but you can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your movement grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm or gap, getting up requires a move action and a DC 15 Climb check.</p>\n\n\t<table>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Long Jump Distance </th>\n\t\t\t<th>Jump DC <sup>1</sup> </th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 5 feet </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 5 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 10 feet </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 10 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 15 feet </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 15 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 20 feet </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 20 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 25 feet </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 25 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 30 feet </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 30 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</table>\n\n\t<p><sup>1</sup> Requires a 20-foot running start.

The DC is equal to 4 times the distance to be cleared. For example, the DC for a high jump to land atop a 3-foot-high ledge is 12 (3 � 4). </p>\n\n\t<p>If you jumped up to grab something, a successful check indicates that you reached the desired height. If you wish to pull yourself up, you can do so with a move action and a DC 15 Climb check. If you fail the Jump check, you do not reach the height, and you land on your feet in the same spot from which you jumped. As with a long jump, the DC is doubled if you do not get a running start of at least 20 feet.</p>\n\n\t<table>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>High Jump Distance <sup>1</sup> </th>\n\t\t\t<th>Jump DC <sup>2</sup> </th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 1 foot </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 4 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 2 feet </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 8 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 3 feet </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 12 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 4 feet </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 16 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 5 feet </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 20 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 6 feet </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 24 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 7 feet </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 28 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> 8 feet </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 32 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</table>\n\n\t<p><sup>1</sup> Not including vertical reach; see below.<br /><sup>2</sup> Requires a 20-foot running start.

The maximum vertical reach (height the creature can reach without jumping) for an average creature of a given size is shown on the table below. (As a Medium creature, a typical human can reach 8 feet without jumping.)

Doing so counts as 10 feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet, then hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Jumping Down:</em> If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if you just fell. The DC to jump down from a height is 15. You do not have to get a running start to jump down, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.</p>\n\n\t<p>If you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did. Thus, if you jump down from a height of just 10 feet, you take no damage. If you jump down from a height of 20 feet, you take damage as if you had fallen 10 feet.</p>",

You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft�s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)\n\nThe basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. (In the game world, is it the skill level required, the time required, and the raw materials required that determine an item�s price.)\n\nIn some cases, the _fabricate_ spell(page 229) can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. However, you must make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship (jewelry, swords, glass, crystal, and so forth).\n\nA successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the _ironwood_ spell (page 246) enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.\nWhen casting the spell _minor creation_ (page 253), you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item. For instance, a successful Craft (bowmaking) check might be required to make straight arrow shafts.\n\nAll crafts require artisan�s tools (page 129) to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a �2 circumstance penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan�s tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.\n\nTo determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.\n# Find the item�s price in Chapter 7: Equipment of this book or in the Dungeon Master�s Guide, or have the DM set the price for an item not otherwise described. Put the price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).\n# Find the DC from the table below, or have the DM set one.\n# Pay one-third of the item�s price for the cost of raw materials.\n# Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week�s work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result � the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result � the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you�ve completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result � the DC doesn�t equal the price, then it  represents the progress you�ve made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces. If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week. If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.\n\n*Progress by the Day:* You can make checks by the day instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result � DC) is in copper pieces instead of silver pieces.\n\n*Creating Masterwork Items:* You can make a masterwork item�a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being magical.\n\nTo create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. Note: The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.\n\n*Repairing Items:* Generally, you can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item�s price.\n\nWhen you use the Craft skill to make a particular sort of item, the DC for checks involving the creation of that item are typically as given on the following table.\n\n|_. Item |_. Craft Skill |_. Craft DC|\n|Acid |Alchemy ^1^ | 15|\n|Alchemist�s fire, smokestick, or tindertwig| Alchemy ^1^ | 20|\n|Antitoxin, sunrod, tanglefoot bag, or thunderstone| Alchemy ^1^ | 25|\n|Armor or shield |Armorsmithing| 10 + AC bonus|\n|Longbow or shortbow |Bowmaking |12|\n|Composite longbow or composite shortbow|Bowmaking |15|\n|Composite longbow or composite shortbow with high strength rating|Bowmaking| 15 +  (2 � rating)|\n|Crossbow| Weaponsmithing |15|\n|Simple melee or thrown weapon| Weaponsmithing |12|\n|Martial melee or thrown weapon |Weaponsmithing |15|\n|Exotic melee or thrown weapon |Weaponsmithing |18|\n|Mechanical trap| Trapmaking |Varies ^2^ |\n|Very simple item (wooden spoon)| Varies| 5|\n|Typical item (iron pot)| Varies| 10|\n|High-quality item (bell)| Varies |15|\n|Complex or superior item (lock)| Varies| 20|\n\n^1^ You must be a spellcaster to craft any of these items.\n^2^ Chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master�s Guide contains a set of rules for how to construct traps.",

That is, you must know what you are trying to emulate when you make an emulation check. The DCs for various tasks involving Use Psionic Device are summarized on the table below.\n\n|_.

You have to wave the item around or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a special +2 bonus if you've activated the item at least once before.\n\nIf you fail the check by 10 or more, you suffer brainburn. This brainburn affects you in the same way as brainburn that can occur when you attempt to manifest a power from a power stone (see page 168), except that the damage is 1d4 points per power level instead of 1d6. Brainburn damage from activating blindly is in addition to brainburn damage from manifesting a power from a power stone.\n\n_Address a Power Stone_: Successfully addressing a power stone allows you to find out what power or powers it contains. Doing this requires 1 minute of concentration.\n\n_Emulate an Ability Score_: To manifest a power from a power stone, you need a high ability score in the appropriate ability (Intelligence for a psion, for instance). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class you're emulating when you try to manifest the power from the power stone) is your check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don't need to make this check.\n\n_Emulate an Alignment_: Some psionic items have positive or negative effects based on your alignment. Use Psionic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You can emulate only one alignment at a time.\n\n_Emulate a Class Feature_: Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a psionic item. Your effective level in the emulated class equals your check result minus 20.\n\nThis skill does not let you use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had the class feature.\n\nIf the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment as a separate check (see above).\n\n_Emulate a Race_: Some psionic items work only for certain races, or work better for those of certain races. You can use such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a time.\n\n_Use a Dorje_: Normally, to use a dorje, you must have the dorje's power on your class power list. This use of the skill allows you to use a dorje as if you had a particular power on your class power list. This use of the skill applies to other power trigger psionic items, if applicable.\n\n_Use a Power Stone_: Normally, to manifest a power from a power stone, you must have the power stone's power on your class power list. This use of the skill allows you to use a power stone as if you had a particular power on your class power list. The DC is equal to 20 + the manifester level of the power you are trying to manifest from the power stone. For instance, to manifest a 2nd-level psion power from a power stone, you would need to roll a 23 or higher since the manifester level for a 2nd-level psion power is 3rd level. _Note_: Before you use a power stone, you must first have addressed it to determine what powers it contains.\n\nIn addition, manifesting a power from a power stone requires a minimum score (10 + power level) in the appropriate ability. If you don't have a high enough score, you must emulate the ability score with a separate check (see above). This use of the skill applies to other power completion psionic items.",

    "check": "You can use this skill to read a spell or to activate a magic item. Use Magic Device lets you use a magic item as if you had the spell ability or class features of another class, as if you were a different race, or as if you were of a different alignment.\n\nYou make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a device such as a wand. If you are using the check to emulate an alignment or some other quality in an ongoing manner (to emulate a neutral evil alignment in order to keep yourself from being damaged by a _book of vile darkness_ you are carrying when you are not evil, for example), you need to make the relevant Use Magic Device check once per hour.\n\nYou must consciously choose which requirement to emulate. That is, you must know what you are trying to emulate when you make a Use Magic Device check for that purpose. The DCs for various tasks involving Use Magic Device checks are summarized on the table below.\n\n|_. Task |_. Use Magic Device DC |\n| Activate blindly | 25 |\n| Decipher a written spell | 25 + spell level |\n| Use a scroll | 20 + caster level |\n| Use a wand | 20 |\n| Emulate a class feature | 20 |\n| Emulate an ability score | See text |\n| Emulate a race | 25 |\n| Emulate an alignment | 30 |\n\n_Activate Blindly_: Some magic items are activated by special words, thoughts, or actions. You can activate such an item as if you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when you're not and even if you don't know it. You do have to perform some equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must speak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a special +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if you've activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you can't activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released but it doesn't do what you wanted it to do. The DM determines the result of a mishaps, as with scroll mishaps. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong target or that uncontrolled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is in addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally run when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast yourself (see the _Dungeon Master's Guide_).\n\n_Decipher a Written Spell_: This usage works just like deciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of concentration.\n\n_Emulate an Ability Score_: To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability (Intelligence for wizard spells, Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for sorcerer or bard spells). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class you're emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll) is your Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don't need to make this check.\n\n_Emulate an Alignment_: Some magic items have positive or negative effects based on the user's alignment. Use Magic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. For example, a _book of vile darkness_ damages nonevil characters who touch it. With a successful Use Magic Device check, Lidda could emulate an evil alignment so that she could handle a _book of vile darkness_ safely. You can emulate only one alignment at a time.\n\n_Emulate a Class Feature_: Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic item. In this case, your effective level in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result minus 20. For example, Lidda finds a magic chalice that turns regular water into holy water when a cleric or an experienced paladin channels positive energy into it as if turning undead. She attempts to activate the item by emulating the cleric's undead turning ability. Her effective cleric level is her check result minus 20. Since a cleric can turn undead at 1st level, she needs a Use Magic Device check result of 21 or higher to succeed.\n\nThis skill does not let you actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class feature.\n\nIf the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).\n\n_Emulate a Race_: Some magic items work only for members of certain races, or work better for members of those races. You can use such an item as if you were a race of your choice. For example, Lidda, a halfling, could attempt to use a _dwarven thrower_ (see page 226 of the _Dungeon Master's Guide_) as if she were a dwarf. If she failed her Use Magic Device check, the hammer would work for her as it normally would for a halfling, but if she succeeded, it would work for her as if she were a dwarf. You can emulate only one race at a time.\n\n_Use a Scroll_: If you are casting a spell from a scroll, you have to decipher it first. Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll's spell on your class spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. For instance, to cast _web_ (a 2nd-level wizard spell) from a scroll, you would need a Use Magic Device check result of 23 or better, since the minimum caster level for _web_ is 3rd level. See the _Dungeon Master's_ Guide for more information on scrolls.\n\nIn addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the appropriate ability. If you don't have a sufficient score in that ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).\n\nThis use of the skill also applies to other spell completion magic items. The _Dungeon Master's Guide_ has more information on such items.\n\n_Use a Wand_: Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand's spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill allows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list.\n\nThis use of the skill also applies to other spell trigger magic items, such as staffs. The _Dungeon Master's Guide_ has more information on such items.",

You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his or her breath only half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round to continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the Constitution check, you begin to drown (see Suffocation and Drowning in the <em>Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide</em>).</p>\n\n\t<p>The DC for the Swim check depends on the water, as given on the table below.</p>\n\n\t<table>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>Water </th>\n\t\t\t<th>Swim DC </th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> Calm water </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 10 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> Rough water </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 15 </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td> Stormy water </td>\n\t\t\t<td> 20 <sup>1</sup> </td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</table>\n\n\t<p><sup>1</sup> You can&#39;t take 10 on a Swim check in stormy water, even if you aren&#39;t otherwise being threatened or distracted.</p>\n\n\t<p>Each hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from fatigue.</p>",

The DC of this check is equal to the DC to speak the utterance you wish to identify.</p>\n\n\t<p>Of the standard classes, only the truenamer has Truespeak as a class skill. Other characters can avoid the high cost of cross-class skills by taking the Truename Training feat (described on page 229).</p>\n\n\t<p>This skill doesn&#39;t represent your ability to learn and know truenames so much as it represents your ability to say them aloud. Each truename is complex and exacting enough that just overhearing a truename�even a personal truename� doesn&#39;t give you any particular facility for pronouncing it yourself. That takes continuous vocal exercises and endless study.</p>",
